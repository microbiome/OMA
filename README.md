# Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis Book <img src="general/figures/mia_logo.png" align="right" width="120" />

## Overview

This is a reference cookbook for performing **Microbiome Analysis** with 
Bioconductor in R. This is a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** 
(https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).

## Deployment

The book is deployed from master branch to GitHub Pages from GitHub
Actions.

You can also build it locally after _cloning_ this Github
repository. This is useful for instance if you like to suggest
improvements in the material. You can use this to test the build
before making a pull request to add your new changes in the official
release.

Building and viewing the book locally involves the following steps:


1. Install the necessary dependencies to build to book, if necessary:

```
BiocManager::install(remotes::local_package_deps(dependencies=TRUE))

# Optionally, you can also run a more comprehensive set of package installations
# (covering the whole book with examples):
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microbiome/OMA/master/install_packages.R")
```



2. Render the book:

```
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::gitbook")
```

3. View the local book version through your browser. If you modify the source files, the changes should update to this version automatically.

```
bookdown::serve_book()
```




## Development and Contributions

To contribute reports, follow the Git flow procedure (you can see instructions
to [getting started with Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)):

1. Fork the project
2. Clone your fork
3. Modify the material
4. Check locally that the changes render successfully (see above)
5. Add and commit the changes to your fork
6. Create a pull request (PR) from your fork back to the original repo
7. Fix and discuss issues in the review process


You can set OMA master branch as your _upstream_ branch and pull the
changes from that before making new Pull Requests (see below). This way you can
make sure that your local version is in sync with the latest full
release.

### Setting upstream

After you forked OMA, you have two repositories to care about:

- **origin:** your own Github fork of OMA, under your github account
- **upstream:** [master branch of OMA](https://github.com/microbiome/OMA/)

The origin you have after you cloned your own fork.

The upstream you can set on command line as follows, for instance (and
you can educate yourself more through various online resources on
using Git/hub):


```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:microbiome/OMA.git
```


Pull changes from the _origin_ and _upstream_ to your local version:

```
git fetch --all
git merge origin/master
git merge upstream/master
```


Sync your local version with the _origin_ and _upstream_:

```
git add . 
git commit -am "my changes"
```


Push your changes to origin:

```
git push origin master
```


After this you can open a PR from origin to the [official master branch](https://github.com/microbiome/OMA/) in Github.




### Adding new sections

Please note that chapters should be independent of each other.

- Create the relevant Rmd file; follow the numbering logic
- Add it also to the list in file [_bookdown.yml](_bookdown.yml). 

### Housekeeping

For developers. This can be used to

 * generate package listing for the full book
 * chapter-specific R files in R/
 * render the book

```
# Generate R files for the book chapters (to be streamlined)
# and the required packages listing 
source("build.R")
```


# Code of conduct

Please note that the OMA project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html).
