You are reading the online book, \href{https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/}{\textbf{Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis
with R and Bioconductor}} \citep{OMA}, where we
walk through common strategies and workflows in microbiome data
science.

The book shows through concrete examples how you can take advantage of
the latest developments in R/Bioconductor for the manipulation,
analysis, and reproducible reporting of hierarchical and heterogeneous
microbiome profiling data sets. The book was borne out of necessity,
while updating microbiome analysis tools to work with Bioconductor
classes that provide support for multi-modal data collections. Many of
these techniques are generic and widely applicable in other contexts
as well.

This work has been heavily influenced by other similar resources, in
particular the Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor
\citep{Amezquita2020}, \href{http://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/tutorials-index}{phyloseq
tutorials}
\citep{Callahan2016} and \href{https://microbiome.github.io/tutorials/}{microbiome
tutorials} \citep{Shetty2019}.
This book extends these resources to teach the grammar of Bioconductor
workflows in the context of microbiome data science. As such, it
supports the adoption of general skills in the analysis of large,
hierarchical, and multi-modal data collections. We focus on microbiome
analysis tools, including entirely new, partially updated as well as
previously established methods.

This online resource and its associated ecosystem of microbiome data
science tools are a result of a community-driven development process,
and welcoming new contributors. Several individuals have
\href{https://github.com/microbiome/OMA/graphs/contributors}{contributed}
methods, workflows and improvements as acknowledged in the
Introduction. You can find more information on how to find us online
and join the developer community through the project homepage at
\href{https://microbiome.github.io}{microbiome.github.io}. This online
resource has been written in RMarkdown with the bookdown R

\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}}

This work - \href{https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/}{\textbf{Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis with R and
Bioconductor}} \citep{OMA} - contributes novel
methods and educational resources for microbiome data science. It
aims to teach the grammar of Bioconductor workflows in the context of
microbiome data science. We show through concrete examples how to use
the latest developments and data analytical strategies in
R/Bioconductor for the manipulation, analysis, and reproducible
reporting of hierarchical, heterogeneous, and multi-modal microbiome
profiling data. The data science methodology is tightly integrated
with the broader R/Bioconductor ecosystem that focuses on the
development of high-quality open research software for life
sciences (\citet{Gentleman2004}, \citet{Huber2015}). The support for modularity and
interoperability is a key to efficient resource sharing and
collaborative development both within and across research fields. The
central data infrastructure, the \texttt{SummarizedExperiment} data container
and its derivatives, have already been widely adopted in microbiome
research, single cell sequencing, and in other fields, allowing a
rapid adoption and extensions of emerging data science techniques
across application domains.

We assume that the reader is already familiar with R programming. For
references and tips on introductory material for R and Bioconductor,
see Chapter \ref{resources}. This online resource and its associated
ecosystem of microbiome data science tools are a result of a
community-driven development process, and welcoming new users and
contributors. You can find more information on how to find us online
and join the developer community through the project homepage at
\href{https://microbiome.github.io}{microbiome.github.io}.

The book is organized into three parts. We start by introducing the
material and link to further resources for learning R and
Bioconductor. We describe the key data infrastructure, the
\texttt{TreeSummarizedExperiment} class that provides a container for
microbiome data, and how to get started by loading microbiome data set
in the context of this new framework. The second section, \emph{Focus
Topics}, covers the common steps in microbiome data analysis,
beginning with the most common steps and progressing to more
specialized methods in subsequent sections. Third, \emph{Workflows},
provides case studies for the various datasets used throughout the
book. Finally, \emph{Appendix}, links to further resources and
acknowledgments.

\hypertarget{packages}{%
\chapter{Packages}\label{packages}}

The Bioconductor microbiome data science framework consists of:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{data containers}, designed to organize multi-assay microbiome data
\item
  \textbf{R packages} that provide dedicated methods for analysing such data
\item
  \textbf{community} of users and developers
\end{itemize}

This section provides an overview of the package ecosystem. Section
\ref{example-data} links to various open microbiome data resources
that support this framework.

\hypertarget{data-science-framework}{%
\section{Data science framework}\label{data-science-framework}}

The building blocks of the framework are \textbf{data container}
(SummarizedExperiment and its derivatives), \textbf{packages} from various
developers using the TreeSE container, open \textbf{demonstration data
sets}, in a separate chapter \ref{example-data}, and \textbf{online
tutorials} including this online book as well as the various package
vignettes and other materials.

\includegraphics[width=18.67in]{general/figures/FigureOverviewV2_mod}

\hypertarget{data-containers}{%
\section{Data containers}\label{data-containers}}

\texttt{SummarizedExperiment} (\texttt{SE}) \citep{R_SummarizedExperiment} is a generic and highly optimized container for complex data
structures. It has become a common choice for analysing various types
of biomedical profiling data, such as RNAseq, ChIp-Seq, microarrays,
flow cytometry, proteomics, and single-cell
sequencing.

{[}\texttt{TreeSummarizedExperiment}{]} (\texttt{TreeSE}) \citep{R_TreeSummarizedExperiment} was developed as an extension to incorporate hierarchical
information (such as phylogenetic trees and sample hierarchies) and
reference sequences.

{[}\texttt{MultiAssayExperiment}{]} (\texttt{MAE}) \citep{Ramos2017} provides an organized way to bind several different data
structures together in a single object. For example, we can bind
microbiome data (in \texttt{TreeSE} format) with metabolomic profiling data
(in \texttt{SE}) format, with shared sample metadata. This is convenient and
robust for instance in subsetting and other data manipulation
tasks. Microbiome data can be part of multiomics experiments and
analysis strategies and we want to outline the understanding in which
we think the packages explained and used in this book relate to these
experiment layouts using the \texttt{TreeSummarizedExperiment} and classes
beyond.

This section provides an introductions to these data containers. In
microbiome data science, these containers link taxonomic abundance
tables with rich side information on the features and
samples. Taxonomic abundance data can be obtained by 16S rRNA amplicon
or metagenomic sequencing, phylogenetic microarrays, or by other
means. Many microbiome experiments include multiple versions and types
of data generated independently or derived from each other through
transformation or agglomeration. We start by providing recommendations
on how to represent different varieties of multi-table data within the
\texttt{TreeSummarizedExperiment} class.

The options and recommendations are summarized in Table \ref{tab:options}.

\hypertarget{assay-slot}{%
\subsection{Assay data}\label{assay-slot}}

The original count-based taxonomic abundance tables may have different
transformations, such as logarithmic, Centered Log-Ratio (CLR), or relative
abundance. These are typically stored in \emph{\textbf{assays}}.

Let us load example data and rename it as tse.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(mia)}
\FunctionTok{data}\NormalTok{(hitchip1006, }\AttributeTok{package=}\StringTok{"miaTime"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{tse }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ hitchip1006}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{assays} slot contains the experimental data as multiple count matrices. The result of \texttt{assays} is a list of matrices.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{assays}\NormalTok{(tse)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## List of length 1

Individual assays can be accessed via \texttt{assay}

## Alcaligenes faecalis et rel.        1        1
\end{verbatim}

To illustrate the use of multiple assays, the relative abundance data can be
calculated and stored along the original count data using \texttt{transformAssay}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tse }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{transformAssay}\NormalTok{(tse, }\AttributeTok{assay.type =} \StringTok{"counts"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{method =} \StringTok{"relabundance"}\NormalTok{)}
\FunctionTok{assays}\NormalTok{(tse)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## List of length 2
## names(2): counts relabundance
\end{verbatim}

Now there are two assays available in the \texttt{tse} object, \texttt{counts} and
\texttt{relabundance}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{assay}\NormalTok{(tse, }\StringTok{"relabundance"}\NormalTok{)[}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{]}

\hypertarget{rowtree}{%
\subsection{rowTree}\label{rowtree}}

Phylogenetic trees also play an important role in the microbiome field. The
\texttt{TreeSummarizedExperiment} class can keep track of features and node
relations via two functions, \texttt{rowTree} and \texttt{rowLinks}.

A tree can be accessed via \texttt{rowTree} as \texttt{phylo} object.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rowTree}\NormalTok{(tse)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## NULL
\end{verbatim}

The links to the individual features are available through \texttt{rowLinks}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rowLinks}\NormalTok{(tse)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## NULL
\end{verbatim}

Please note that there can be a 1:1 relationship between tree nodes and
features, but this is not a must-have. This means there can be features, which
are not linked to nodes, and nodes, which are not linked to features. To change
the links in an existing object, the \texttt{changeTree} function is available.

\hypertarget{alt-exp}{%
\subsection{Alternative experiments}\label{alt-exp}}

\emph{\textbf{Alternative experiments}} complement \emph{assays}. They can contain
complementary data, which is no longer tied to the same dimensions as
the assay data. However, the number of samples (columns) must be the
same.

This can come into play, for instance, when one has taxonomic
abundance profiles quantified with different measurement technologies,
such as phylogenetic microarrays, amplicon sequencing, or metagenomic
sequencing. Another common use case is including abundance tables for
different taxonomic ranks. Such alternative experiments concerning the
same set of samples can be stored as

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Separate \emph{assays} assuming that the taxonomic information can be mapped
  between features directly 1:1; or
\item
  Data in the \emph{altExp} slot of the \texttt{TreeSummarizedExperiment}, if the feature
  dimensions differ. Each element of the \emph{altExp} slot is a \texttt{SummarizedExperiment}
  or an object from a derived class with independent feature data.
\end{enumerate}

The following shows how to store taxonomic abundance tables
agglomerated at different taxonomic levels. However, the data could as
well originate from entirely different measurement sources as long as
the samples match.

Let us first agglomerate the data to Phylum level. This yields a new
TreeSE data object.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tse\_phylum }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{agglomerateByRank}\NormalTok{(tse, }\StringTok{"Phylum"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{na.rm=}\ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\# Both have the same number of columns (samples)}
\FunctionTok{dim}\NormalTok{(tse)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1]  130 1151
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{dim}\NormalTok{(tse\_phylum)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1]    8 1151
\end{verbatim}

Then we can add the new phylum-level data object as an alternative experiment in the original data.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Add the new data object to the original data object as an alternative experiment with the name "Phylum"}
\FunctionTok{altExp}\NormalTok{(tse, }\StringTok{"Phylum"}\NormalTok{) }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ tse\_phylum}

\CommentTok{\# Check the alternative experiment names available in the data}
\FunctionTok{altExpNames}\NormalTok{(tse)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "Phylum"
\end{verbatim}

We can now subset the data, for instance, and this acts on both altExp and assay data.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tse[,}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{]}

\hypertarget{mae}{%
\subsection{MultiAssayExperiments}\label{mae}}

\emph{\textbf{Multiple experiments}} relate to complementary measurement types,
such as transcriptomic or metabolomic profiling of the microbiome or
the host. Multiple experiments can be represented using the same
options as alternative experiments, or by using the
\texttt{MultiAssayExperiment} class \citep{Ramos2017}. Depending on how the
datasets relate to each other the data can be stored as:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Separate \emph{altExp} if the samples can be matched directly 1:1; or
\item
  As \texttt{MultiAssayExperiment} objects, in which the connections between
  samples are defined through a \texttt{sampleMap}. Each element on the
  \texttt{experimentsList} of an \texttt{MultiAssayExperiment} is \texttt{matrix} or
  \texttt{matrix}-like objects, including \texttt{SummarizedExperiment} objects, and
  the number of samples can differ between the elements.
\end{enumerate}

For information have a look at the \href{https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/MultiAssayExperiment/inst/doc/MultiAssayExperiment.html}{intro vignette} of the \texttt{MultiAssayExperiment} package.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}rlrr@{}}
\caption{\label{tab:options} \textbf{Recommended options for storing multiple data tables in microbiome studies} The \emph{assays} are best suited for data transformations (one-to-one match between samples and columns across the assays). The \emph{alternative experiments} are particularly suitable for alternative versions of the data that are of same type but may have a different number of features (e.g.~taxonomic groups); this is for instance the case with taxonomic abundance tables agglomerated at different levels (e.g.~genus vs.~phyla) or alternative profiling technologies (e.g.~amplicon sequencing vs.~shallow shotgun metagenomics). For alternative experiments one-to-one match between samples (cols) is libraryd but the alternative experiment tables can have different numbers of features (rows). Finally, elements of the \emph{MultiAssayExperiment} provide the most flexible way to incorporate multi-omic data tables with flexible numbers of samples and features. We recommend these conventions as the basis for methods development and application in microbiome studies.}\tabularnewline

Result of amplicon sequencing is a large number of files that include all the sequences
that were read from samples. Those sequences need to be matched with taxa. Additionally,
we need to know how many times each taxa were found from each sample.

There are several algorithms to do that, and DADA2 is one of the most common.
You can find DADA2 pipeline tutorial, for example,
\href{https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html}{here}.
After the DADA2 portion of the tutorial is completed, the data is stored into \emph{phyloseq} object
(Bonus: Handoff to phyloseq). To store the data to \emph{TreeSummarizedExperiment},
follow the example below.

\hypertarget{import-from-file}{%
\subsection{Import from external files}\label{import-from-file}}

Microbiome (taxonomic) profiling data is commonly distributed in
various file formats. You can import such external data files as a
(Tree)SummarizedExperiment object, but the details depend on the file
format. Here, we provide examples for common formats. Some datasets and raw
files to learn how to import raw data and construct TreeSE/MAE containers are
available in the
\href{https://github.com/microbiome/data}{microbiome data repository}.

\hypertarget{csv-import}{%
\subsubsection{CSV import}\label{csv-import}}

\textbf{CSV data tables} can be imported with the standard R functions,
then converted to the desired format. For detailed examples, you can
check the \href{https://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2019/BSS2019/04_Practical_CoreApproachesInBioconductor.html}{Bioconductor course
material}
by Martin Morgan. You can also check the \href{https://github.com/microbiome/OMA/tree/master/data}{example
files} and
construct your own CSV files accordingly.

Recommendations for the CSV files are the following. File names are
arbitrary; we refer here to the same names as in the examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Abundance table (\texttt{assay\_taxa.csv}): data matrix (features x
  samples); first column provides feature IDs, the first row provides
  sample IDs; other values should be numeric (abundances).
\item
  Row data (\texttt{rowdata\_taxa.csv}): data table (features x info); first
  column provides feature IDs, the first row provides column headers;
  this file usually contains the taxonomic mapping between different
  taxonomic levels. Ideally, the feature IDs (row names) match one-to-one with
  the abundance table row names.
\item
  Column data (\texttt{coldata.csv}): data table (samples x info); first
  column provides sample IDs, the first row provides column headers;
  this file usually contains the sample metadata/phenodata (such as
  subject age, health etc). Ideally, the sample IDs match one-to-one with
  the abundance table column names.
\end{itemize}

After you have set up the CSV files, you can read them in R:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{count\_file  }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"data/assay\_taxa.csv"}
\NormalTok{tax\_file    }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"data/rowdata\_taxa.csv"}
\NormalTok{sample\_file }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"data/coldata.csv"}

\CommentTok{\# Load files}
\NormalTok{counts  }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read.csv}\NormalTok{(count\_file, }\AttributeTok{row.names=}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)   }\CommentTok{\# Abundance table (e.g. ASV data; to assay data)}
\NormalTok{tax     }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read.csv}\NormalTok{(tax\_file, }\AttributeTok{row.names=}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)     }\CommentTok{\# Taxonomy table (to rowData)}
\NormalTok{samples }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read.csv}\NormalTok{(sample\_file, }\AttributeTok{row.names=}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)  }\CommentTok{\# Sample data (to colData)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

After reading the data in R, ensure the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  abundance table (\texttt{counts}): numeric \texttt{matrix}, with feature IDs as
  rownames and sample IDs as column names
\item
  rowdata (\texttt{tax}): \texttt{DataFrame}, with feature IDs as rownames. If this
  is a \texttt{data.frame} you can use the function \texttt{DataFrame()} to change
  the format. Column names are free but in microbiome analysis they
  usually they refer to taxonomic ranks. The rownames in rowdata
  should match with rownames in abundance table.
\item
  coldata (\texttt{samples}): \texttt{DataFrame}, with sample IDs as rownames. If
  this is a \texttt{data.frame} you can use the function \texttt{DataFrame()} to
  change the format. Column names are free. The rownames in coldata
  should match with colnames in abundance table.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Always ensure that the tables have rownames!} The \emph{TreeSE} constructor compares
rownames and ensures that, for example, right samples are linked with right patient.

Also ensure that the row and column names match one-to-one between
abundance table, rowdata, and coldata:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Match rows and columns}
\NormalTok{counts }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ counts[}\FunctionTok{rownames}\NormalTok{(tax), }\FunctionTok{rownames}\NormalTok{(samples)]}

\CommentTok{\# Let us ensure that the data is in correct (numeric matrix) format:}
\NormalTok{counts }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{as.matrix}\NormalTok{(counts)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you hesitate about the format of the data, you can compare to one
of the available demonstration datasets, and make sure that your data
components have the same format.

There are many different source files and many different ways to read
data in R. One can do data manipulation in R as well. Investigate the
entries as follows.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# coldata rownames match assay colnames}

\hypertarget{constructing-treesummarizedexperiment}{%
\subsection{Constructing TreeSummarizedExperiment}\label{constructing-treesummarizedexperiment}}

Now let us create the TreeSE object from the input data tables. Here
we also convert the data objects in their preferred formats:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  counts --\textgreater{} numeric matrix
\item
  rowData --\textgreater{} DataFrame
\item
  colData --\textgreater{} DataFrame
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{SimpleList} could be used to include multiple alternative assays, if
necessary.

                                     \AttributeTok{rowData =} \FunctionTok{DataFrame}\NormalTok{(tax))}

\NormalTok{tse\_taxa}

Now you should have a ready-made TreeSE data object that can be used in downstream analyses.

\hypertarget{constructing-multiassayexperiment}{%
\subsection{Constructing MultiAssayExperiment}\label{constructing-multiassayexperiment}}

To construct a \emph{MultiAssayExperiment} object, just combine multiple \emph{TreeSE} data containers.
Here we import metabolite data from the same study.

                                           \AttributeTok{colData =} \FunctionTok{DataFrame}\NormalTok{(samples))}

\NormalTok{tse\_metabolite}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Now we can combine these two experiments into \emph{MAE}.

\hypertarget{import-functions-for-standard-formats}{%

Specific import functions are provided for:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

  Biom files (see \texttt{help(mia::loadFromBiom)})
\item
  QIIME2 files (see \texttt{help(mia::loadFromQIIME2)})
\item
  Mothur files (see \texttt{help(mia::loadFromMothur)})
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{biom-import}{%
\subsubsection{Biom import}\label{biom-import}}

This example shows how \href{https://biom-format.org/}{Biom files} are imported into
a \texttt{TreeSummarizedExperiment} object.

The data is from following publication:
Tengeler AC \emph{et al.} (2020) \href{https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-020-00816-x}{\textbf{Gut microbiota from persons with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder affects the brain in
mice}}.

The dataset consists of 3 files:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  biom file: abundance table and taxonomy information
\item
  csv file: sample metadata
\item
  tree file: phylogenetic tree
\end{itemize}

Store the data in your desired local directory (for instance, \emph{data/} under the
working directory), and define source file paths

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{biom\_file\_path }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{"data/Aggregated\_humanization2.biom"}

Now we can load the biom data into a SummarizedExperiment (SE) object.

The \texttt{assays} slot includes a list of abundance tables. The imported
abundance table is named as ``counts''. Let us inspect only the first
cols and rows.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{rowdata} includes taxonomic information from the biom file. The \texttt{head()} command
shows just the beginning of the data table for an overview.

\texttt{knitr::kable()} is for printing the information more nicely.

\begin{Shaded}

These taxonomic rank names (column names) are not real rank
names. Let's replace them with real rank names.

In addition to that, the taxa names include, e.g., '\,``k\_\_' before the name, so let's

Now, let's add a phylogenetic tree.

The current data object, se, is a SummarizedExperiment object. This
does not include a slot for adding a phylogenetic tree. In order to do
this, we can convert the SE object to an extended TreeSummarizedExperiment
object which includes also a \texttt{rowTree} slot.

TreeSummarizedExperiment contains also other additional slots and features which
is why we recommend to use \texttt{TreeSE}.

If the data has already been imported in R in another format, it
can be readily converted into \texttt{TreeSummarizedExperiment}, as shown in our next
example. Note that similar conversion functions to
\texttt{TreeSummarizedExperiment} are available for multiple data formats via
the \texttt{mia} package (see makeTreeSummarizedExperimentFrom* for phyloseq,

We can also convert \texttt{TreeSummarizedExperiment} objects into \texttt{phyloseq}
with respect to the shared components that are supported by both
formats (i.e.~taxonomic abundance table, sample metadata, taxonomic
table, phylogenetic tree, sequence information). This is useful for
instance when additional methods are available for \texttt{phyloseq}.

\subsection{Subsetting}\label{subsetting}}

\textbf{Subsetting} data helps to draw the focus of analysis on particular
sets of samples and / or features. When dealing with large datasets,
the subset of interest can be extracted and investigated
separately. This might improve performance and reduce the
computational load.

Load:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  mia
\item
  dplyr
\item
  knitr
\item
  data \texttt{GlobalPatterns}
\end{itemize}

Let us store \texttt{GlobalPatterns} into \texttt{tse} and check its original number of features (rows) and samples (columns). \textbf{Note}: when subsetting by sample, expect the number of columns to decrease; when subsetting by feature, expect the number of rows to decrease.

\hypertarget{subset-by-sample-column-wise}{%
\subsubsection{Subset by sample (column-wise)}\label{subset-by-sample-column-wise}}

For the sake of demonstration, here we will extract a subset containing only the samples of human origin (feces, skin or tongue), stored as \texttt{SampleType} within \texttt{colData(tse)} and also in \texttt{tse}.

First, we would like to see all the possible values that \texttt{SampleType} can take on and how frequent those are:

\begin{Shaded}

\CommentTok{\# Inspect possible values for SampleType}

\hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

\textbf{Note}: after subsetting, expect the number of columns to equal the
sum of the frequencies of the samples that you are interested
in. For instance, \texttt{ncols\ =\ Feces\ +\ Skin\ +\ Tongue\ =\ 4\ +\ 3\ +\ 2\ =\ 9}.

Next, we \emph{logical index} across the columns of \texttt{tse} (make sure to
leave the first index empty to select all rows) and filter for the
samples of human origin. For this, we use the information on the
samples from the meta data \texttt{colData(tse)}.

As a sanity check, the new object \texttt{tse\_subset\_by\_sample} should have
the original number of features (rows) and a number of samples
(columns) equal to the sum of the samples of interest (in this case
9).

Several characteristics can be used to subset by sample:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  origin
\item
  sampling time
\item
  sequencing method
\item
  DNA / RNA barcode
\item
  cohort
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{subset-by-feature-row-wise}{%
\subsubsection{Subset by feature (row-wise)}\label{subset-by-feature-row-wise}}

Similarly, here we will extract a subset containing only the features
that belong to the phyla Actinobacteria and Chlamydiae, stored as
\texttt{Phylum} within \texttt{rowData(tse)}. However, subsetting by feature implies
a few more obstacles, such as the presence of \texttt{NA} elements and the
possible need for agglomeration.

As previously, we would first like to see all the possible values that
\texttt{Phylum} can take on and how frequent those are:

Depending on your research question, you might or might not need to
agglomerate the data in the first place: if you want to find the
abundance of each and every feature that belongs to Actinobacteria and
Chlamydiae, agglomeration is not needed; if you want to find the total
abundance of all features that belong to Actinobacteria or
Chlamydiae, agglomeration is recommended.

\hypertarget{non-agglomerated-data}{%
\paragraph{Non-agglomerated data}\label{non-agglomerated-data}}

Next, we \emph{logical index} across the rows of \texttt{tse} (make sure to leave
the second index empty to select all columns) and filter for the
features that fall in either Actinobacteria or Chlamydiae group. For this,
we use the information on the samples from the metadata
\texttt{rowData(tse)}.

The first term with the \texttt{\%in\%} operator includes all the features
of interest, whereas the second term after the AND operator \texttt{\&}
filters out all features that have an \texttt{NA} in place of the phylum variable.

When total abundances of certain phyla are of relevance, the data is initially agglomerated by Phylum. Then, similar steps as in the case of non-agglomerated data are followed.

\textbf{Note}: as data was agglomerated, the number of rows should equal the
number of phyla used to index (in this case, just 2).

The code above returns the non-agglomerated version of the data.

Fewer characteristics can be used to subset by feature:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Taxonomic rank
\item
  Meta-taxonomic group
\end{itemize}

For subsetting by kingdom, agglomeration does not apply, whereas for
the other ranks it can be applied if necessary.

\hypertarget{subset-by-sample-and-feature}{%
\subsubsection{Subset by sample and feature}\label{subset-by-sample-and-feature}}

Finally, we can subset data by sample and feature at once. The
resulting subset contains all the samples of human origin and all the
features of phyla Actinobacteria or Chlamydiae.

\textbf{Note}: the dimensions of \texttt{tse\_subset\_by\_sample\_feature} agree with
those of the previous subsets (9 columns filtered by sample and 1652
rows filtered by feature).

If a study was to consider and quantify the presence of Actinobacteria
as well as Chlamydiae in different sites of the human body,
\texttt{tse\_subset\_by\_sample\_feature} might be a suitable subset to start
with.

This can occur, for example, after the data subsetting. In certain analyses, we might want to
remove those instances.

\texttt{splitByRanks} splits the data based on taxonomic ranks. Since the elements of the output list
share columns, they can be stored into \texttt{altExp}.

This chapter focuses on the quality control and exploration of
microbiome data and establishes commonly used descriptive
summaries. Familiarizing with the peculiarities of a given dataset is
the essential basis for any data analysis and model building.

The dataset should not suffer from severe technical biases, and you
should at least be aware of potential challenges, such as outliers,
biases, unexpected patterns and so forth. Standard summaries and
visualizations can help, and the rest comes with experience. The
exploration and quality control can be iterative processes.

\hypertarget{prevalence}{%
\section{Prevalence}\label{prevalence}}

Prevalence quantifies the frequency of samples where certain microbes
were detected (above a given detection threshold). The prevalence can
be given as sample size (N) or percentage (unit interval).

Investigating prevalence allows you either to focus on changes which
pertain to the majority of the samples, or identify rare microbes,
which may be \emph{conditionally abundant} in a small number of samples.

The population prevalence (frequency) at a 1\% relative abundance
threshold (\texttt{detection\ =\ 1/100} and \texttt{as\_relative\ =\ TRUE}), can look
like this.

Note that, by default, \texttt{na.rm\ =\ TRUE} is used for agglomeration in
\texttt{getPrevalence}, whereas the default for \texttt{agglomerateByRank} is
\texttt{FALSE} to prevent accidental data loss.

If you only need the names of the prevalent taxa, \texttt{getPrevalentTaxa}
is available. This returns the taxa that exceed the given prevalence
and detection thresholds.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{getPrevalentTaxa}\NormalTok{(tse, }\AttributeTok{detection =} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{prevalence =} \DecValTok{50}\SpecialCharTok{/}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{prev}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that the \texttt{detection} and \texttt{prevalence} thresholds are not the same, since
\texttt{detection} can be applied to relative counts or absolute counts depending on
whether \texttt{as\_relative} is set \texttt{TRUE} or \texttt{FALSE}

The function `getPrevalentAbundance' can be used to check the total
relative abundance of the prevalent taxa (between 0 and 1).

\hypertarget{plotting-prevalence}{%

\texttt{rowData}. Here, we are analysing the Phylum level abundances, which

In addition, data can be rarefied with
\href{https://microbiome.github.io/mia/reference/subsampleCounts.html}{subsampleCounts},
which normalises the samples to an equal number of reads. However,
this practice has been discouraged for the analysis of differentially
abundant microorganisms (see \citep{mcmurdie2014waste}).

\hypertarget{contaminant-sequences}{%

Samples might be contaminated with exogenous sequences. The impact of
each contaminant can be estimated based on their frequencies and
concentrations across the samples.

The following \href{https://microbiome.github.io/mia/reference/isContaminant.html}{decontam

Taxonomic information is a key part of analyzing microbiome data and without
it, any type of data analysis probably will not make much sense. However,
the degree of detail of taxonomic information differs depending on the dataset
and annotation data used.

Therefore, the mia package expects a loose assembly of taxonomic information
and assumes certain key aspects:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Taxonomic information is given as character vectors or factors in the
  \texttt{rowData} of a \texttt{SummarizedExperiment} object.
\item
  The columns containing the taxonomic information must be named \texttt{domain},
  \texttt{kingdom}, \texttt{phylum}, \texttt{class}, \texttt{order}, \texttt{family}, \texttt{genus}, \texttt{species} or with
  a capital first letter.
\item
  the columns must be given in the order shown above
\item
  column can be omited, but the order must remain
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{assigning-taxonomic-information.}{%
\section{Assigning taxonomic information.}\label{assigning-taxonomic-information.}}

There are a number of methods to assign taxonomic information. We like to give
a short introduction about the methods available without ranking one over the
other. This has to be your choice based on the result for the individual
dataset.

\hypertarget{dada2}{%
\subsection{dada2}\label{dada2}}

The dada2 package \citep{Callahan2016dada2} implements the \texttt{assignTaxonomy}
function, which takes as input the ASV sequences associated with each
row of data and a training dataset. For more information visit the
\href{https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/assign.html}{dada2 homepage}.

\hypertarget{decipher}{%
\subsection{DECIPHER}\label{decipher}}

The DECIPHER package \citep{R_DECIPHER} implements the \texttt{IDTAXA} algorithm to assign
either taxonomic information or function information. For \texttt{mia}
only the first option is of interest for now and more information can be
found on the \href{http://www2.decipher.codes/Classification.html}{DECIPHER website}.

\texttt{altExpNames} now consists of \texttt{Family} level data. This can be extended to use
any taxonomic level listed in \texttt{mia::taxonomyRanks(tse)}.

Rare taxa can also be aggregated into a single group ``Other'' instead of filtering them out. A suitable function for this is \texttt{agglomerateByPrevance}. The number of rare taxa is higher on the species level, which causes the need for data agglomeration by prevalence.

\section{Data transformation}\label{assay-transform}}

Data transformations are common in microbiome analysis. Examples
include the logarithmic transformation, calculation of relative
abundances (percentages), and compositionality-aware transformations
such as the centered log-ratio transformation (clr).

In mia package, transformations are applied to abundance data. The transformed
abundance table is stored back to `assays'. mia includes transformation
function (`transformAssay()') which applies sample-wise or column-wise transformation when MARGIN = `samples', feature-wise or row-wise transformation when MARGIN = `features'.

For a complete list of available transformations and parameters, see function
\href{https://microbiome.github.io/mia/reference/transformAssay.html}{help}.

Diversity estimates are a central topic in microbiome data analysis.

There are three commonly employed levels of diversity measurements,
which are trying to put a number on different aspects of the questions
associated with diversity \citep{Whittaker1960}.

Many different ways for estimating such diversity measurements have been
described in the literature. Which measurement is best or applicable for your
samples, is not the aim of the following sections.

\textbf{\emph{Alpha diversity}}, also sometimes interchangeably used with the
term \textbf{\emph{species diversity}}, summarizes the distribution of species
abundances in a given sample into a single number that depends on
species richness and evenness. Diversity indices measure the overall
community heterogeneity. A number of ecological diversity measures are
available. The Hill coefficient combines many standard indices into a
single equation that provides observed richness, inverse Simpson, and
Shannon diversity, and generalized diversity as special cases. In
general, diversity increases together with increasing richness and
evenness. Sometimes richness, phylogenetic diversity, evenness, dominance,
and rarity are considered to be variants of alpha diversity.

\textbf{Richness} refers to the total number of species in a community
(sample). The simplest richness index is the number of observed
species (observed richness). Assuming limited sampling from the
community, however, this may underestimate the true species
richness. Several estimators are available, including for instance ACE
\citep{Chao1992} and Chao1 \citep{Chao1984}. Richness estimates are unaffected
by species abundances.

\textbf{Phylogenetic diversity} was first proposed by \citep{Faith1992}. Unlike the
diversity measures mentioned above, Phylogenetic diversity (PD)
measure incorporates information from phylogenetic relationships
stored in \texttt{phylo} tree between species in a community (sample). The
Faith's PD is calculated as the sum of branch length of all species in
a community (sample).

\textbf{Evenness} focuses on species abundances, and can thus complement
the number of species. A typical evenness index is the Pielou's
evenness, which is Shannon diversity normalized by the observed
richness.

\textbf{Dominance} indices are in general negatively correlated with
diversity, and sometimes used in ecological literature. High
dominance is obtained when one or few species have a high share of
the total species abundance in the community.

\textbf{Rarity} indices characterize the concentration of taxa at low abundance.
Prevalence and detection thresholds determine rare taxa whose total concentration
is represented as a rarity index.

\hypertarget{estimation}{%
\section{Estimation}\label{estimation}}

Alpha diversity can be estimated with wrapper functions that interact
with other packages implementing the calculation, such as \emph{\texttt{vegan}}
\citep{R_vegan}.

\hypertarget{richness}{%
\subsection{Richness}\label{richness}}

Richness gives the number of features present within a community and can be calculated with \texttt{estimateRichness}. Each of the estimate diversity/richness/evenness/dominance functions adds the calculated measure(s) to the \texttt{colData} of the \texttt{SummarizedExperiment} under the given column \texttt{name}. Here, we calculate \texttt{observed} features as a measure of richness.

Alpha diversities can be visualized with boxplot. Here, Shannon index is compared
between different sample type groups. Individual data points are visualized by
plotting them as points with \texttt{geom\_jitter}.

\texttt{geom\_signif} is used to test whether these differences are statistically significant.
It adds p-values to plot.

\hypertarget{community-similarity}{%
\chapter{Community Similarity}\label{community-similarity}}

Whereas alpha diversity focuses on community variation within a community
(one sample), beta diversity quantifies the dissimilarity between communities
(multiple samples). In microbiome research, the most popular metrics of beta
diversity include the Bray-Curtis index (for compositional data), Jaccard index
(for presence / absence data, ignoring abundance information), Aitchison distance
(Euclidean distance for clr transformed abundances, aiming to avoid the
compositionality bias), and the Unifrac distance (that takes into account the
phylogenetic tree information). Notably, only some of these measures are actual
\emph{distances}, as this is a mathematical concept whose definition is not satisfied
by certain ecological measure, such as the Bray-Curtis index. Therefore, the terms
dissimilarity and beta diversity are preferred.

In practice, beta diversity is usually represented as a \texttt{dist} object, a
triangular matrix where the distance between each pair of samples is encoded by
a specific cell. This distance matrix can then undergo ordination, which is an
important ecological tool to reduce the dimensionality of data for a more
efficient analysis and visualization. Ordination techniques aim to capture as
much essential information from the data as possible and turn it into a lower
dimensional representation. Dimension reduction is bound to lose information but
commonly used ordination techniques can preserve relevant information of sample
similarities in an optimal way, which is defined in different ways by different
methods. {[}TODO add references and/or link to ordination chapter instead?{]}

Based on the type of algorithm, ordination methods in microbiome research can
be generally divided in two categories: unsupervised and supervized ordination.
The former includes Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA), Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension
Reduction (UMAP), whereas the latter is mainly represented by distance-based
Redundance Analysis (dbRDA). We will first discuss unsupervized ordination
methods and then proceed to supervized ones.

To run the examples in this chapter, the following packages should be imported:

Unsupervized ordination methods variation in the data without additional
information on covariates or other supervision of the model. Among the different
approaches, Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) and non-metric MDS (NMDS) can be
regarded as the standard. They are jointly referred to as PCoA. For this
demonstration we will analyse beta diversity in GlobalPatterns, and observe the
variation between stool samples and those with a different origin.

\subsection{Comparing communities by beta diversity analysis}\label{comparing-communities-by-beta-diversity-analysis}}

A typical comparison of community compositions starts with a visual
representation of the groups by a 2D ordination. Then we estimate relative
abundances and MDS ordination based on Bray-Curtis index between the groups,
and visualize the results.

In the following examples dissimilarity is calculated with the function supplied
to the \texttt{FUN} argument. Several metrics of beta diversity are defined by the \texttt{vegdist}
function of the vegan package, which is often used in this context. However, such
custom functions created by the user also work, as long as they return a \texttt{dist}
object. In either case, this function is then applied to calculate reduced
dimensions via an ordination method, the results of which can be stored in the
\texttt{reducedDim} slot of the TreeSE. This entire process is contained by the \texttt{runMDS}
and \texttt{runNMDS} functions.

\hypertarget{explained-variance}{%
\subsection{Explained variance}\label{explained-variance}}

The percentage of explained variance is typically shown for PCA
ordination plots. This quantifies the proportion of overall variance
in the data that is captured by the PCA axes, or how well the
ordination axes reflect the original distances.

Sometimes a similar measure is shown for MDS/PCoA. The interpretation
is generally different, however, and hence we do not recommend using
it. PCA is a special case of PCoA with Euclidean distances. With
non-Euclidean dissimilarities PCoA uses a trick where the pointwise
dissimilarities are first cast into similarities in a Euclidean space
(with some information loss i.e.~stress) and then projected to the
maximal variance axes. In this case, the maximal variance axes do not
directly reflect the correspondence of the projected distances and
original distances, as they do for PCA.

In typical use cases, we would like to know how well the ordination
reflects the original similarity structures; then the quantity of
interest is the so-called ``stress'' function, which measures the
difference in pairwise similarities between the data points in the
original (high-dimensional) vs.~projected (low-dimensional) space.

Hence, we propose that for PCoA and other ordination methods, users
would report relative stress, which varies in the unit interval and is better
if smaller. This can be calculated as shown below.

\section{Supervized ordination}\label{supervized-ordination}}

dbRDA is a supervized counterpart of PCoA, that is, it takes into account the
covariates specified by the user to maximize the variance with respect to the
them. The result shows how much each covariate affects beta diversity. The table
below illustrates the relation between supervized and unsupervized ordination
methods.

We demonstrate the usage of dbRDA with the enterotype TreeSE, where samples
correspond to patients. The colData contains the clinical status of each patient
as well as a few covariates such as their gender and age, which can be included
in the supervized model together with the clinical status, the main outcome variable.
dbRDA can be perfomed with the \texttt{calculateRDA} function, which lies at the center
of the following workflow.

\subsection{Testing differences in community composition between sample groups}\label{dbrda-workflow}}

Permutational Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA; \citeyearpar{Anderson2001}) is
a widely used non-parametric multivariate method that aims to
estimate the actual statistical significance of differences in the
observed community composition between two groups of samples.

PERMANOVA tests the hypothesis that the centroids and dispersion
of the community are equivalent between the compared groups. A p-value
smaller than the significance threshold indicates that the groups have a
different community composition. This method is implemented with the
\href{https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/vegan/versions/2.4-2/topics/adonis}{\texttt{adonis2}}
function from the vegan package.

By default, the argument \texttt{by} is set to \texttt{"terms"}, in which the order of variables
in the formula matters. In this case, each variable is analyzed sequentially, and
the result is different when more than 1 variable is introduced and their order differs.
Therefore, it is recommended to set \texttt{by\ =\ "margin"}, which specifies that the
marginal effect of each variable is analyzed individually. You can view a
comparison between the two designs in chapter \ref{compare-permanova}.

We can perform PERMANOVA either with \texttt{adonis2} function or by first performing
dbRDA and then applying permutational test its results. An advantage of the latter
approach is that by doing so we can get coefficients: how much each taxa affects
the variation between communities.

As we can see, the community composition is significantly different
between the groups (p \textless{} 0.05), and these two methods give equal p-values.

Let us visualize the model coefficients for species that exhibit the
largest differences between the groups. This gives some insights into
how the groups tend to differ from each other in terms of community
composition.

In the example above, the largest differences between the two groups
can be attributed to \emph{Genus:Bacteroides} (elevated in the first
group) and \emph{Family:Ruminococcaceae} (elevated in the second
group), and many other co-varying species.

\hypertarget{checking-the-homogeneity-condition}{%

It is important to note that the application of PERMANOVA assumes
homogeneous group dispersions (variances). This can be tested with the
PERMDISP2 method \citep{Anderson2006} by using the same assay and distance
method than in PERMANOVA.

\subsection{Composition heatmap}\label{composition-heatmap}}

Community composition can be visualized with heatmap, where the
horizontal axis represents samples and the vertical axis the
taxa. Color of each intersection point represents abundance of a taxon
in a specific sample.

Here, abundances are first CLR (centered log-ratio) transformed to
remove compositionality bias. Then Z transformation is applied to
CLR-transformed data. This shifts all taxa to zero mean and unit
variance, allowing visual comparison between taxa that have different
absolute abundance levels. After these rough visual exploration
techniques, we can visualize the abundances at Phylum level.

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique. The idea of
it is to find clusters from the data. A cluster is a group of
features/samples that share pattern. For example, with clustering, we
can find group of samples that share similar community
composition. There are multiple clustering algorithms available.

\emph{bluster} is a Bioconductor package specialized in clustering. It offers
multiple algorithms such as hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, K-means,
amongst others. The first thing to do when using this package is to load
it, and transform the data if necessary, depending on your analysis goals.

Alternatively, it's also possible to use the \texttt{clusterCells} function from

\hypertarget{taxa-clustering}{%

Similarly to samples, it's also possible to cluster taxa.
Prior to clustering, the data should be modified with compositionally
aware transformations such as CLR. Then, simply follow the same steps as
with samples, using the \texttt{clusterRows} function, then putting the cluster
indices in rowData. At the end, you can also merge the rows using the
clusters indices.

\hypertarget{hierarchical-clustering}{%
\section{Hierarchical clustering}\label{hierarchical-clustering}}

Hierarchical clustering aims to find hiearchy between
samples/features. There are to approaches: agglomerative (``bottom-up'')
and divisive (``top-down'').

In agglomerative approach, each observation is first unique cluster.
Algorithm continues by agglomerating similar clusters. Divisive
approach starts with one cluster that contains all the
observations. Clusters are splitted recursively to clusters that
differ the most. Clustering ends when each cluster contains only one
observation.

Hierarchical clustering can be visualized with dendrogram tree. In each
splitting point, the three is divided into two clusters leading to
hierarchy.

\hypertarget{k-means-clustering}{%
\section{K-means clustering}\label{k-means-clustering}}

Hierarchical clustering did not yield clusters. Let's try k-means
clustering instead. Here observations are divided into clusters so
that the distances between observations and cluster centers are
minimized; an observation belongs to cluster whose center is the
nearest.

The algorithm starts by dividing observation to random clusters whose
number is defined by user. The centroids of clusters are then
calculated. After that, observations' allocation to clusters are
updated so that the means are minimized. Again, centroid are
calculated, and algorithm continues iteratively until the assignments
do not change.

\hypertarget{dirichlet-multinomial-mixtures-dmm}{%
\section{Dirichlet Multinomial Mixtures (DMM)}\label{dirichlet-multinomial-mixtures-dmm}}

This section focus on DMM analysis.

One technique that allows to search for groups of samples that are
similar to each other is the \href{https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030126}{Dirichlet-Multinomial Mixture
Model}. In
DMM, we first determine the number of clusters (k) that best fit the
data (model evidence) using Laplace approximation. After fitting the
model with k clusters, we obtain for each sample k probabilities that
reflect the probability that a sample belongs to the given cluster.

Let's cluster the data with DMM clustering.

\section{Community Detection}\label{community-detection}}

Another approach for discovering communities within the samples of the
data, is to run community detection algorithms after building a
graph. The following demonstration builds a graph based on the k
nearest-neighbors and performs the community detection on the fly.

\emph{\texttt{bluster}} \citep{R_bluster} package offers several clustering methods,
among which graph-based are present, enabling the community detection
task.

Installing package:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(bluster)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The algorithm used is ``short random walks'' \citep{Pons2006}. Graph is
constructed using different k values (the number of nearest neighbors
to consider during graph construction) using the robust centered log
ratio (rclr) assay data. Then plotting the communities using UMAP
\citep{McInnes2018} ordination as a visual exploration aid. In the
following demonstration we use the \texttt{enterotype} dataset from the
\citep{R_mia} package.

Similarly, the \emph{\texttt{bluster}} \citep{R_bluster} package offers clustering
diagnostics that can be used for judging the clustering quality (see

\hypertarget{biclustering}{%
\section{Biclustering}\label{biclustering}}

Biclustering methods cluster rows and columns simultaneously in order
to find subsets of correlated features/samples.

Here, we use following packages:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/biclust/index.html}{biclust}
\item
  \href{https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13582}{cobiclust}
\end{itemize}

\emph{cobiclust} is especially developed for microbiome data whereas \emph{biclust} is more
general method. In this section, we show three different cases and example
solutions to apply biclustering to them.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Taxa vs samples
\item
  Taxa vs biomolecule/biomarker
\item
  Taxa vs taxa
\end{enumerate}

Biclusters can be visualized using heatmap or boxplot, for
instance. For checking purposes, also scatter plot might be valid
choice.

Check more ideas for heatmaps from chapters \ref{viz-chapter} and
@ref(microbiome-community.

\end{verbatim}

The object includes cluster information. However compared to
\emph{cobiclust}, \emph{biclust} object includes only information about clusters
that were found, not general cluster.

Meaning that if one cluster size of 5 features was found out of 20 features,
those 15 features do not belong to any cluster. That is why we have to create an
additional cluster for features/samples that are not assigned into any cluster.

Now we can create a scatter plot. X-axis includes median clr abundance
of microbiome and y-axis median absolute concentration of each
metabolite. Each data point represents a single sample.

From the plots, we can see that there is low negative correlation in
both cluster 1 and 3. This means that when abundance of bacteria
belonging to cluster 1 or 3 is higher, the concentration of
metabolites of cluster 1 or 3 is lower, and vice versa.

Hierarchical clustering requires 2 steps. In the fist step, dissimilarities are

sequencing data is compositional, relative transformation is applied.

We can use dendrogram to determine the number of clusters. Usually the
tree is splitted where the branch length is the largest. However, as
we can see from the dendrogram, clusters are not clear. Algorithms are

\hypertarget{differential-abundance-analysis}{%
\section{Differential abundance analysis}\label{differential-abundance-analysis}}

This section provides an introduction to Differential Abundance Analysis (DAA),
which is used to identify differences in the abundances of individual taxa (at
any taxonomic level) between two or more groups, such as treatment and control.
Here, we demonstrate its implementation on peerj13075, one of the \protect\hyperlink{package-data}{mia datasets}.

The goal of DAA is to identify biomarkers of a certain phenotype or condition,
and gain understanding of a complex system by looking at its isolated components.
For example, the identification of a bacterial taxon that is differentially
abundant between healthy patients and diseased patients can lead to important
insights into the pathophysiology of the disease. In other words, differentially
abundant taxa can be involved in the dynamics of the disease, which in turn helps
understand the system as a whole. Despite its relevance in current research,
the DAA approach has also been subject to debate \citep{Quinn2021}.

\hypertarget{examples-and-tools}{%
\subsection{Examples and tools}\label{examples-and-tools}}

Due to the size and complexity of microbiome sequencing data, in this field
DAA still faces several statistical challenges \citep{Yang2022}. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  High variability. The abundance of a specific taxon could range over
  several orders of magnitude.
\item
  Zero-inflation. In a typical microbiome dataset, more than 70\% of the
  values are zeros. Zeros could be due to either physical absence
  (structural zeros) or insufficient sampling effort (sampling zeros).
\item
  Compositionality. Increase or decrease in the (absolute) abundance of
  one taxon at the sampling site will lead to apparent changes in the
  relative abundances of other taxa in the sample.
\end{itemize}

As a consequence, the following approaches have been developed:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Over-dispersed count models has been proposed to address zero
  inflation, such as the negative binomial model used by edgeR
  \citep{Chen2016} and DESeq2 \citep{Love2014}, the beta-binomial model used by
  corncorb \citep{Martin2021}.
\item
  Zero-inflated mixture models has aslo been proposed to address zero
  inflation, such as zero-inflated log-normal/normal mixture model
  used by metagenomeSeq \citep{Paulson2017} and RAIDA \citep{Sohn2015},
  zero-inflated beta-binomial model used by ZIBB \citep{ZIBB2018}, and
  zero-inflated negative binomial model used by Omnibus
  \citep{Omnibus2018}.
\item
  Bayesian methods have been used to impute the zeros for methods
  working on proportion data, accounting for sampling variability and
  sequencing depth variation. Examples include ALDEx2 \citep{Gloor2016} and
  eBay \citep{Liu2020}.
\item
  Other methods use the pseudo-count approach to impute the zeros,
  such as MaAsLin2 \citep{Mallick2020} and ANCOMBC \citep{ancombc2020}.
\item
  Different strategies have been used to address compositional
  effects, including:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Robust normalization. For example, trimmed mean of M-values (TMM)
    normalization used by edgeR, relative log expression (RLE)
    normalization used by DESeq2 \citep{Love2014}, cumulative sum scaling
    (CSS) normalization used by metagenomeSeq, centered log-ratio
    transformation (CLR) normalization used by ALDEx2 \citep{Gloor2016} and
    geometric mean of pairwise ratios (GMPR) normalization used by
    Omnibus \citep{Omnibus2018}. Wrench normalization \citep{Kumar2018} corrects
    the compositional bias by an empirical Bayes approach, which has
    been recommended in metagenomeSeq \citep{Paulson2017} tutorial.
  \item
    Reference taxa approach used by DACOMP \citep{Brill2019} and RAIDA \citep{Sohn2015}.
  \item
    Analyzing the pattern of pairwise log ratios, such as ANCOM \citep{Mandal2015}.
  \item
    Bias-correction used by ANCOMBC \citep{ancombc2020}.
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

We recommend to have a look at \citet{Nearing2022} who compared all these
methods across 38 different datasets. Because different methods use
different approaches (parametric vs non-parametric, different
normalization techiniques, assumptions etc.), the results may differ
between methods, sometimes substantially as \citet{Nearing2022} pointed
out. More recently \citet{Yang2022} comprehensively evaluated these methods
via a semi-parametric framework and 106 real datasets. \citet{Yang2022} also
concluded that different DA methods can sometimes produce discordant
results, opening to the possibility for cherry-picking tools in favor
of one's own hypothesis. Therefore it is highly recommended to pick
several methods to assess how robust and potentially reproducible your
findings are with different methods.

In this section we demonstrate the use of four methods that can be
recommended based on recent literature (ANCOM-BC \citep{ancombc2020},
\emph{ALDEx2} \citep{Gloor2016}, \emph{Maaslin2} \citep{Mallick2020}, \emph{LinDA} \citep{Zhou2022}
and \emph{ZicoSeq} \citep{Yang2022}).

The purpose of this section is to show how to perform DAA in R, not
how to correctly do causal inference. Depending on your experimental
setup and your theory, you must determine how to specify any model
exactly. E.g., there might be confounding factors that might drive
(the absence of) differences between the shown groups that we ignore
here for simplicity. Or your dataset is repeated sampling design,
matched-pair design or the general longitudianl design. We will
demonstrate how to include covariates in those models. We picked a
dataset that merely has microbial abundances in a TSE object as well
as a grouping variable in the sample data. We simplify the examples by
only including two of the three groups.

Regarding prevalence filtering, \citet{Nearing2022} found that applying a 10\%
threshold for the prevalence of the taxa generally resulted in more
robust results. Some tools have builtin arguments for that. By
applying the threshold to our input data, we can make sure it is
applied for all tools.

\hypertarget{aldex2}{%
\subsection{ALDEx2}\label{aldex2}}

In this section, we will show how to perform a simple ALDEx2 analysis.
If you wanted to pick a single method, this method could be recommended to use.
According to the developers experience, it tends to identify the common
features identified by other methods. This statement is in line with a recent
independent evaluation by \citet{Nearing2022}.\\
Please also have a look at the more extensive
\href{https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ALDEx2/inst/doc/ALDEx2_vignette.html}{vignette}
that covers this flexible tool in more depth. ALDEx2 estimates technical
variation within each sample per taxon by utilizing the Dirichlet distribution.
It furthermore applies the centered-log-ratio transformation (or closely
related log-ratio transforms). Depending on the experimental setup, it will
perform a two sample Welch's T-test and Wilcoxon-test or a one-way ANOVA and
Kruskal-Wallis-test. For more complex study designs, there is a possibility to
utilize the \texttt{glm} functionality within ALDEx2.

The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure is applied by default to correct for
multiple testing. Below we show a simple example that illustrates the
workflow.

Now, we can create a so called Bland-Altman or MA plot (left). It shows the
association between the relative abundance and the magnitude of the difference
per sample. Next to that, we can also create a plot that shows the dispersion
on the x-axis instead of log-ratio abundance. Red dots represent genera that are
differentially abundant (\(q \leq 0.1\)) between the 2 groups. Black points are
rare taxa and grey ones are abundant taxa. The dashed line represent an effect
size of 1. See \citet{Gloor2016} to learn more about these plots.

The evaluation as differential abundant in above plots is based on the
corrected p-value. According to the ALDEx2 developers, the safest
approach is to identify those features where the 95\% CI of the effect
size does not cross 0. As we can see in below table, this is not the
case for any of the identified genera (see overlap column, which
indicates the proportion of overlap). Also, the authors recommend to
focus on effect sizes and CIs rather than interpreting the p-value. To
keep the comparison simple, we will here use the p-value as decision
criterion. But please be aware that the effect size together with the
CI is a better answer to the question we are typically interested in
(see also \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9}{this

\hypertarget{ancom-bc}{%
\subsection{ANCOM-BC}\label{ancom-bc}}

The analysis of composition of microbiomes with bias correction
(ANCOM-BC) \citep{ancombc2020} is a recently developed method for differential
abundance testing. It is based on an earlier published approach
\citep{Mandal2015}. The previous version of ANCOM was among the methods
that produced the most consistent results and is probably a
conservative approach \citep{Nearing2022}. However, the new ANCOM-BC
method operates quite differently compared to the former ANCOM method.

As the only method, ANCOM-BC incorporates the so called \emph{sampling
fraction} into the model. The latter term could be empirically
estimated by the ratio of the library size to the microbial
load. According to the authors, variations in this sampling fraction
would bias differential abundance analyses if ignored. Furthermore,
this method provides p-values and confidence intervals for each
taxon. It also controls the FDR and it is computationally simple to
implement.

Note that the original method was implemented in the \texttt{ancombc()} function (see
\href{https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ANCOMBC/inst/doc/ANCOMBC.html}{extended tutorial}).
The method has since then been updated and new features have been added to enable
multi-group comparisons and repeated measurements among other improvements.
We do not cover the more advanced features of ANCOMBC in this tutorial
as these features are documented in detail in this
\href{https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ANCOMBC/inst/doc/ANCOMBC2.html}{tutorial}.

We now proceed with a simple example. First, we specify a formula. In this
formula, other covariates could potentially be included to adjust for
confounding. We show this further below. Again, please make sure to check the
\href{https://rdrr.io/github/FrederickHuangLin/ANCOMBC/man/ancombc.html}{function documentation}
as well as the linked tutorials to learn about the additional arguments
that we specify.

Lastly, we cover linear models for differential abundance analysis of
microbiome compositional data (\citet{Zhou2022}). This is very similar to
ANCOMBC with few differences: 1) LinDA correct for the compositional
bias differently using the mode of all regression coefficients. 2) it
is faster (100x-1000x than ANCOMBC and according to the authors); 3)
it supports hierarchical models. The latest ANCOMBC versions are also
supporting hierarchical models. Nevertheless, LinDA seems a promising
tool that achieves a very good power/fdr trade-off together with
ANCOMBC according to the review. The speed improvements might make it
critical especially for datasets that have higher sample or feature
set sizes.

This approach has been assessed to exhibit high power and a low false
discovery rate, which has the following components:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Winsorization to decrease the influence of outliers;
\item

  sampling variability and zero inflation;
\item
  Reference-based multiple-stage normalization to address
  compositional effects;

\subsection{Comparison of methods}\label{comparison-of-methods}}

The different methods yield somewhat different results but they could
be also expected to overlap to a substantial degree. As an exercirse,
you can compare the outcomes between the different methods in terms of
effect sizes, significances, or other aspects that are comparable
between the methods.

\hypertarget{confounding-variables}{%
\section{Confounding variables}\label{confounding-variables}}

Confounders are common in experimental research. In general, these can be
classified into 3 types:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Biological confounder, such as age, sex, etc.
\item
  Technical confounder that caused by data collection, storage, DNA
  extraction, sequencing process, etc.
\item
  Confounder caused by experimental models, such as cage effect,
  sample background, etc.
\end{itemize}

Adjusting confounder is necessary and important to reach a valid
conclusion. To perform causal inference, it is crucial that the method
is able to include covariates in the model. This is not possible with
e.g.~the Wilcoxon test. Other methods such as DESeq2, edgeR, ANCOMBC,
LDM, Aldex2, Corncob, MaAsLin2, ZicoSeq, fastANCOM and ZINQ allow
this. Below we show how to include a confounder/covariate in ANCOMBC,
LinDA and ZicoSeq.

Machine learning (ML) is a part of artificial intelligence. There are multiple
definitions, but ``machine'' refers to computation and ``learning'' to improving
performance based on the data by finding patterns from it. Machine learning
includes wide variety of methods from simple statistical methods to more
complex methods such as neural-networks.

Machine learning can be divided into supervised and unsupervised machine learning.
Supervised ML is used to predict outcome based on the data. Unsupervised ML is used,
for example, to reduce dimensionality (e.g.~PCA) and to find clusters from the
data (e.g., k-means clustering).

\hypertarget{supervised-machine-learning}{%
\section{Supervised machine learning}\label{supervised-machine-learning}}

``Supervised'' means that the training data is introduced before. The training data
contains labels (e.g., patient status), and the model is fitted based on the
training data. After fitting, the model is utilized to predict labels of data whose
labels are not known.

``Unsupervised'' means that the labels (e.g., patient status is not known),
and patterns are learned based only the abundance table, for instance.
Unsupervised ML is also known as a data mining where patterns are extracted
from big datasets.

Multi-omics approaches integrate data from multiple sources. For
example, we can integrate taxonomic abundance profiles with
metabolomic or other biomolecular profiling data to observe
associations, make predictions, or aim at causal
inferences. Integrating evidence across multiple sources can lead to
enhanced predictions, more holistic understanding, or facilitate the
discovery of novel biomarkers. In this section we demonstrate common
multi-assay data integration tasks.

Cross-correlation analysis is a straightforward approach that can
reveal strength and type of assocations between data sets. For instance,
we can analyze if higher presence of a specific taxon relates to higher
levels of a biomolecule.

The analyses can be facilitated by the multi-assay data containers,
\emph{TreeSummarizedExperiment} and \emph{MultiAssayExperiment}. These are
scalable and contain different types of data in a single container,
making this framework particularly suited for multi-assay microbiome
data incorporating different types of complementary data sources in a
single reproducible workflow. Solutions to a number of data
integration problems are discussed in more detail in Section
\ref{containers}. Another experiment can be stored in \emph{altExp} slot
of SE data container. Alternatively, both experiments can be stored
side-by-side in a MAE data container (see sections \ref{alt-exp} and \ref{mae}
to learn more about altExp and MAE objects, respectively). Different
experiments are first imported as single-assay data containers similarly to
the case when only one experiment is present. After that, the
different experiments can be combined into one multi-assay data
container. The result is a MAE object with multiple experiments in its
experiment slot, or a TreeSE object with alternative experiments in
the altExp slot.

As an example, we use a dataset from the following publication:
\citeyearpar{Hintikka2021} Xylo-oligosaccharides in prevention of hepatic
steatosis and adipose tissue inflammation: associating taxonomic and
metabolomic patterns in fecal microbiota with biclustering.
In this study, mice were fed either with a high-fat or a low-fat diet,
and with or without prebiotics, for the purpose studying whether prebiotics
attenuate the negative impact of a high-fat diet on health.

This example data can be loaded from microbiomeDataSets. The data is
already in MAE format. It includes three different experiments:
microbial abundance data, metabolite concentrations, and data about
different biomarkers. If you like to construct the same data object from the
original files instead, \href{https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/containers.html\#loading-experimental-microbiome-data}{here}
you can find help for importing data into an SE object.

\section{Multi-Omics Factor Analysis}\label{mofa}}

Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) is an unsupervised method for integrating multi-omic data sets in a downstream analysis \citep{Argelaguet2018}. It could be
seen as a generalization of principal component analysis. Yet, with the ability
to infer a latent (low-dimensional) representation, shared among the multiple
(-omics) data sets in hand.

We use the R \href{https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/index.html}{MOFA2}
package for the analysis, and
\href{https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/installation.html}{install} the
corresponding dependencies.

Data visualization will inevitably shape interpretation and motivate
the next steps of the analysis. A variety of visualization methods are
available for microbiome analysis but the application requires careful
attention to details. Knowledge on the available tools and their
limitations plays an important role in selecting the most suitable
methods to address a given question.

This chapter introduces the reader to a number of visualization
techniques found in this book, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  barplots
\item
  boxplots
\item
  heatmaps
\item
  ordination charts
\item
  regression charts
\item
  trees
\end{itemize}

The toolkit which provides the essential plotting functionality
includes the following packages:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{patchwork}, \emph{cowplot}, \emph{ggpubr} and \emph{gridExtra}: plot layout and multi-panel plotting
\item
  \emph{miaViz}: specific visualization tools for \texttt{TreeSummaizedExperiment} objects
\item
  \emph{scater}: specific visualization tools for \texttt{SingleCellExperiment} objects
\item
  \emph{ggplot2}, \emph{pheatmap}, \emph{ggtree}, \emph{sechm}: composition heatmaps
\item
  \emph{ANCOMBC}, \emph{ALDEx2} and \emph{Maaslin2}: visual differential abundance
\item
  \emph{fido}: tree-based methods for differential abundance
\item
  \emph{plotly}: animated and 3D plotting
\end{itemize}

with open data. Additionally, \texttt{rowData} and \texttt{colData} allow
manipulation and subsetting of large data sets into smaller units, as
explained in chapter \ref{datamanipulation}.

\hypertarget{viewing-abundance-and-prevalence-patterns}{%
\subsection{Viewing abundance and prevalence patterns}\label{viewing-abundance-and-prevalence-patterns}}

Prior-to-analysis exploration may involve questions such as how microorganisms
are distributed across samples (abundance) and what microorganisms are present
in most of the samples (prevalence). The information on abundance and prevalence
can be summarized into a \textbf{jitter} or \textbf{density plot} and a \textbf{tree},
respectively, with the \emph{miaViz} package.

Specifically, the functions \texttt{plotAbundance}, \texttt{plotAbundanceDensity}
and \texttt{plotRowTree} are used, and examples on their usage are discussed
throughout chapter \ref{quality-control}.

\hypertarget{diversity-estimation}{%
\section{Diversity estimation}\label{diversity-estimation}}

Alpha diversity is commonly measured as one of the diversity indices
explained in chapter \ref{community-diversity}. Because the focus
lies on each sample separately, one-dimensional plots, such as
\textbf{scatter}, \textbf{violin} and \textbf{box plots}, are suitable.

Beta diversity is generally evaluated as one of the dissimilarity
indices reported in chapter \ref{community-similarity}. Unlike alpha
diversity, samples are compared collectively to estimate the
heterogeneity across them, therefore multidimensional plots, such as
\textbf{Shepard} and \textbf{ordination plots} are suitable.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\centering\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 4\tabcolsep) * \real{0.3125}}

In conclusion, visualization techniques for alpha and beta diversity
significantly differ from one another.

\hypertarget{alpha-diversity-with-scatter-violin-and-box-plots}{%
\subsection{Alpha diversity with scatter, violin and box plots}\label{alpha-diversity-with-scatter-violin-and-box-plots}}

The basic method to visualize the diversity values assigned to the
different samples in a \texttt{TSE} object includes the following, where each
data point represents one sample:

\includegraphics{19_visualization_techniques_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf}

The several indices available for the evaluation of alpha diversity
often return slightly divergent results, which can be visually
compared with a multiple violin or box plot. For this purpose,
\texttt{plotColData} (for violin plots) or \texttt{ggplot} (for box plots) are
recursively applied to a number of diversity indices with the function
\texttt{lapply} and the multi-panel plotting functionality of the \emph{patchwork}
package is then exploited.

The analogous output in the form of a violin plot is obtained in
chapter \ref{faith-diversity}. In addition, box plots that group
samples according to certain information, such as origin, sex, age and
health condition, can be labeled with p-values for significant
differences with the package \emph{ggsignif} package, as shown in chapter
\ref{estimate-diversity}.

The \emph{scater} package offers the general function \texttt{plotReducedDim}. In
its basic form, it takes a \texttt{TSE} object and the results on sample
similarity stored in the same object, which can be evaluated with the
following coordination methods:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{runMDS}
\item
  \texttt{runNMDS}
\item
  \texttt{runPCA}
\item
  \texttt{runTSNE}
\item
  \texttt{runUMAP}
\end{itemize}

Since these clustering techniques allow for multiple coordinates or
components, \textbf{coordination plots} can also span multiple dimensions,
which is explained in chapter \ref{extras}.

\subsection{Heatmaps}\label{heatmaps}}

As described in chapter \ref{visual-composition}, bar plots and
heatmaps can offer a useful insight into the composition of a
community. Simple methods involve the functions \texttt{plotAbundance} and
\texttt{geom\_tile} in combination with \texttt{scale\_fill\_gradientn} from the
packages \emph{miaViz} and \emph{ggplot2}, respectively.

For instance, below the composition of multiple samples (x axis) is
reported in terms of relative abundances (y axis) for the top 10 taxa
at the Order rank. Bar plots and heatmaps with analogous information
at the Phylum level are available in the aforementioned chapter.

The package \emph{sechm} allows for further visual capabilities and flexibility.
In this case, the clustering step is automatically performed by the plotting
function and does not need to be executed in advance.

It is also possible to create an analogous heatmap by just using the
\emph{ggplot2} package. However, a relatively long code is required to
generate an identical output.

  \href{https://www.rstudio.com/}{Rstudio home page} for more
  information. RStudio is optional.
\item
  Install key R packages (Section \ref{packages} provides an installation script)
\item
  After a successful installation you can consider trying out examples
  from Section \ref{exercises} already before training. \textbf{You can run
  the workflows by simply copy-pasting examples.} You can then test
  further examples from this tutorial, modifying and applying these
  techniques to your own data. Plain source code for the individual chapters of this book are available via \href{https://github.com/microbiome/OMA/tree/master/R}{Github}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{alternative-containers-for-microbiome-data}{%
\subsection{Alternative containers for microbiome data}\label{alternative-containers-for-microbiome-data}}

The \texttt{phyloseq} package and class became the first widely used data
container for microbiome data science in R. Many methods for taxonomic
profiling data are readily available for this class. We provide here a
short description how \texttt{phyloseq} and \texttt{*Experiment} classes relate to
each other.

\texttt{assays} : This slot is similar to \texttt{otu\_table} in \texttt{phyloseq}. In a
\texttt{SummarizedExperiment} object multiple assays, raw
counts, transformed counts can be stored. See also
\citeyearpar{Ramos2017}
for storing data from multiple \texttt{experiments} such as
RNASeq, Proteomics, etc. \texttt{rowData} : This slot is
similar to \texttt{tax\_table} in \texttt{phyloseq} to store taxonomic
information. \texttt{colData} : This slot is similar to
\texttt{sample\_data} in \texttt{phyloseq} to store information
related to samples. \texttt{rowTree} : This slot is similar
to \texttt{phy\_tree} in \texttt{phyloseq} to store phylogenetic tree.

In this book, you will come across terms like \texttt{FeatureIDs} and
\texttt{SampleIDs}. \texttt{FeatureIDs} : These are basically OTU/ASV ids which are
row names in \texttt{assays} and \texttt{rowData}. \texttt{SampleIDs} : As the name
suggests, these are sample ids which are column names in \texttt{assays} and
row names in \texttt{colData}.

\texttt{FeatureIDs} and \texttt{SampleIDs} are used but the technical terms
\texttt{rownames} and \texttt{colnames} are encouraged to be used, since they relate
to actual objects we work with.

Here you can find assignments on different topics.

\textbf{Tips for exercises:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Add comments that explain what each line or lines of code do. This helps you and others understand your code and find bugs. Furthermore, it is easier for you to reuse the code, and it promotes transparency.
\item
  Interpret results by comparing them to literature. List main findings, so that results can easily be understood by others without advanced knowledge on data analytics.
\item
  Avoid hard-coding. Use variables which get values in the beginning of the pipeline. That way it is easier for you to modify parameters and reuse the code.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{reproducible-reporting-with-quarto}{%
\subsection{Reproducible reporting with Quarto}\label{reproducible-reporting-with-quarto}}

The following batch of exercises walks you through typical use cases of Quarto
in RStudio. Before heading to the exercises, it is recommended to read the
\href{https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio.html}{Quarto guidelines for RStudio}

\hypertarget{new-document}{%
\subsubsection{New document}\label{new-document}}

This exercise gets you started with creating a Quarto document and adding
text to it with typing conventions borrowed from the
\href{https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html}{markdown syntax}.
Feel free to render the document with the \textbf{Render} button after each step to
see the changes in the final report.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Open RStudio and create a new Quarto file named \texttt{My\ first\ Quarto}.
\item
  Add the subtitle \texttt{My\ first\ section} and write some text of your choice
  underneath. You can choose the level of headings by the number of preceding
  hashes (\texttt{\#}).
\item
  Add a subsection named \texttt{List\ of\ items} and list three items underneath, both
  ordered and unordered. You can initialize items with numbers (\texttt{1.}, \texttt{2.},
  \texttt{3.}, \ldots) or stars (\texttt{*}) for the ordered and unordered case, respectively.
\item
  Add another subsection named \texttt{Link\ to\ web} and add a clickable link to the
  \href{https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/}{OMA book}, using the pattern \texttt{{[}text{]}(url)}.
\item
  Render the document and check its appearance
\end{enumerate}

Nice start! You are now able to create a Quarto document, understand its syntax
and can render it into a reproducible report. If you got stuck, you can look up
the docs on \href{https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio.html\#creating-documents}{creating}
and \href{https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio.html\#render-and-preview}{rendering}
Quarto documents.

\hypertarget{code-chunks}{%
\subsubsection{Code chunks}\label{code-chunks}}

While customizable text is nothing new by itself, the advantage of Quarto (and
previously Rmakdown) is to combine text with code in R or other programming
languages, so that both the analytical pipeline and verbal description can be
put in one place. In this exercise, we learn how to write and run code in Quarto.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Open RStudio and create a new Quarto file.
\item
  Initialize a code chunk by pressing \texttt{alt} + \texttt{cmd} + \texttt{i} and define the variables
  \texttt{A\ \textless{}-\ "my\ name"} and \texttt{B\ \textless{}-\ 0} in it.
\item
  Write the text \texttt{Below\ is\ my\ first\ code\ chunk} just above the code chunk.
\item
  Initialize one more code chunk and add 100 to the variable \texttt{B} in it.
\item
  Write the text \texttt{Below\ I\ change\ variable\ B} just above the second chunk.
\item
  \textbf{Extra}: Write the following line of text: \texttt{my\ name\ is\ A\ and\ I\ am\ B\ years\ old},
  where A and B are variables defined in the code chunks upstream and change if
  those variables are modified. Be aware that inline code can be added as
  \texttt{\textgreater{}\ r\ my\_inline\_command} (without \texttt{\textgreater{}}).
\end{enumerate}

Good job. You are now able to combine text and code in a Quarto document. If you
got stuck, you can refer to the Quarto docs on
\href{https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html\#code-chunks}{using code chunks}.

\hypertarget{knitr-options}{%
\subsubsection{Knitr options}\label{knitr-options}}

Code chunks can be greatly customized in terms of visibility and execution,
output size and location and much more. This is possible with the knitr chunk
options, which usually appear at the beginning of the target chunk with the
syntax \texttt{\#\textbar{}\ option-name:\ value}, also described
\href{https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html\#chunk-options}{here}.
In this exercise, we explore part of the knitr potential.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Open RStudio and create a new Quarto file.
\item
  Initialize three code chunks and label them as \texttt{setup}, \texttt{fig-box} and
  \texttt{tbl-coldata}, respectively. Remember that the name of a chunk can be
  specified with the \texttt{label} option.
\item
  Write the following code in the corresponding chunk and render the document.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# setup}
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(mia)}
\FunctionTok{data}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"GlobalPatterns"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{package =} \StringTok{"mia"}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Set \texttt{include:\ false} in the \texttt{setup} chunk, \texttt{fig-width:\ 10} in the \texttt{fig-box}
  chunk and \texttt{echo:\ false} in the \texttt{tbl-coldata} chunk. Render the document again
  and find the differences from before.
\item
  Add the options \texttt{fig-cap} and \texttt{tab-cap} to the \texttt{fig-box} and \texttt{tbl-coldata}
  chunks, respectively. They require some text input, which makes for the
  caption of the figures or tables.
\item
  \textbf{Extra}: Create a cross-reference to \texttt{fig-box} and \texttt{tbl-coldata} in the
  text above the respective code chunk. You can do that with the syntax
  \texttt{@chunk-name}.
\item
  \textbf{Extra}: Define a custom folder for storing figures with \texttt{fig-path}. Insert
  it in \texttt{knitr::opts\_chunk\$set}, so that it applies globally to all the figures
  generated in the document.
\end{enumerate}

Congratulations! You are now familiar with the great potential and flexibility
of knitr chunk options. An exhaustive list of available options can be found
in the \href{https://yihui.org/knitr/options/}{knitr documentation}.

\hypertarget{yaml-instructions}{%
\subsubsection{YAML instructions}\label{yaml-instructions}}

The box at the beginning of every Quarto document contains yaml options that let
you define the metadata of the document. They will affect the appearance of the
document when it is rendered. By default, the box includes yaml options for the
title, format and editor to be used, but much more information on layout, code
execution and figures can be specified. A comprehensive list of yaml options is
available \href{https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html}{here}. In this
exercise, we will get a tiny taste of such functionality.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Open RStudio and create a new Quarto file.
\item
  In the yaml box at the beginning of the document, change the title from
  \texttt{Untitled} to \texttt{My\ first\ Quarto}.
\item
  In the same box, add the two lines \texttt{author} and \texttt{date} followed by your name
  and today's date, respectively.
\item
  Render the document and check its appearance.
\item
  \textbf{Extra}: Set \texttt{toc:\ true} to produce a table of contents. This line should
  follow \texttt{format} and \texttt{html} at the second level of indentation.
\end{enumerate}

Well done! Now you are able to specify yaml options and understand how they
affect your Quarto document. If you got stuck, you can check
\href{https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio.html\#yaml-intelligence}{this section} of
the Quarto documentation.

\hypertarget{quarto-parameters}{%
\subsubsection{Quarto parameters}\label{quarto-parameters}}

An advanced feature of Quarto consists of execution parameters, which are
externally pre-defined variables that are also accessible in the Quarto document.
They can be specified in the yaml box as \texttt{params}. Here we learn how to use them.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Open RStudio and create a new Quarto file.
\item
  In the yaml box at the beginning of the document, add a line named \texttt{params}
  followed by an indented line with \texttt{gamma:\ 10}
\item
  Initialize a code chunk and type \texttt{str(params\$gamma)} in it.
\item
  Render the document and check what happened.
\item
  Define one more parameter \texttt{beta:\ 3} and multiply \texttt{gamma} by \texttt{beta} in a code
  chunk below.
\item
  Render the document again and check what happened.
\end{enumerate}

Well done! You can now use an advanced feature of Quarto such as parameters.
If you got stuck, \href{https://quarto.org/docs/computations/parameters.html\#knitr}{here}
you can find more information about parameter definition and usage.

\hypertarget{data-containers-treese}{%
\section{Data containers: TreeSE}\label{data-containers-treese}}

TreeSE containers represent the working unit of the mia package. In the

A few demo datasets can be imported with mia and can be accessed as explained
in chapter \ref{example-data}.

\hypertarget{construct-TreeSE}{%
\subsection{Constructing a data object}\label{construct-TreeSE}}

Here we cover how to construct a TreeSE from CSV files, using the components
of OKeefeDSData from the microbiomeDataSets package as an example dataset.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Download the files with the prefix \emph{DS} from
  \href{https://github.com/JuliaTurkuDataScience/MicrobiomeAnalysis.jl/tree/main/src/assets}{this directory}.
\item
  Read in the csv files with \texttt{read.csv} and store them into the variables
  \texttt{assays}, \texttt{rowdata} and \texttt{coldata}, respectively.
\item
  Create a TreeSE from the individual components with \texttt{TreeSummarizedExperiment}.
  Note that the function requires three arguments: assays, rowData and colData,
  to which you can give the appropriate item.
\item
  Check that importing is done correctly. E.g., choose random samples and features,
  and check that their values equal between raw files and TreeSE.
\end{enumerate}

\item
  Check the names of the generated altExps with \texttt{altExpNames} and retrieve a

\end{enumerate}

In this example, we inspected the correlation between two related variables,
also known as multicollinearity, and checked the correlation to library size,
which is part of quality control. However, the correlation between alpha diversity

represent an important analysis in several studies.

  reducedDims are likely found, because we haven't created any yet.
\item
  Perform PCA and store its output in the TreeSE by running
  \texttt{tse\ \textless{}-\ runPCA(tse,\ assay.type\ =\ "counts")}. Note that it is required to
  specify the assay on which dimensionality reduction should be conducted.
\item

\item
  \textbf{Extra}: Access the \texttt{PCA} reducedDim object with \texttt{reducedDim} and explore

  and set the optional arguments \texttt{ncomponents} and \texttt{assay.type} to the
  appropriate values.
\item
  Plot the first two dimensions of PCA with \texttt{plotReducedDim}, to which you
  should give the appropriate reducedDim name as the second argument. Note that
  by default only the first two dimensions are shown.
\item
  Check which information is stored in the ColData of the TreeSE. What would
  be worth visualizing in our coordination plot?
\item

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{principal-coordinate-analysis-pcoa}{%
\subsection{Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA)}\label{principal-coordinate-analysis-pcoa}}

PCoA turns out to be particularly relevant for microbiome analysis, because
unlike PCA it can generate reduced dimensions from distances other than
Euclidean. There are several ecological distances to choose from and you can
find many of them under methods in the vignettes of \texttt{vegan::vegdist}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Import the mia and scater packages, load enterotype with \texttt{data} and store it
  into a variable named \texttt{tse}.
\item
  Transform the counts assay to relative abundances with \texttt{transformAssay}.
\item
  Perform a Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) based on the relative abundance
  assay in terms of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. You can use \texttt{runMDS} with the
  compulsory argument \texttt{FUN\ =\ vegan::vegdist}.
\item
  Plot the first two dimensions of PCA with \texttt{plotReducedDim}, to which you
  should give the appropriate reducedDim name as the second argument. Colour
  the observations by Enterotype with \texttt{colour\_by}.
\item
  \textbf{Extra}: Perform MDS again with \texttt{runMDS}, but this time use Jaccard
  dissimilarity. The distance metric to use can be defined with the optional
  argument \texttt{method}, choosing from the methods in \texttt{?vegan::vegdist}. If you
  don't want to overwrite the reducedDim object made in point 3, set \texttt{name} to
  a name of your choice. Visualize and compare it to the plot from point 4.
\end{enumerate}

Good job! You are now able to produce and visualize reduced dimensions of a
TreeSE. \texttt{runMDS} is actually one of several algorithms for PCoA and dimensionality
reduction, which you can find in section \ref{other-ord-methods}.

\hypertarget{permanova-analysis}{%
\subsection{PERMANOVA analysis}\label{permanova-analysis}}

In this exercise we focus on studying the weight of variables on the microbiome
composition. Significance of each variable on beta diversity is tested with
PERMANOVA (point 4) and the homogeneity assumption is also be controlled with a
PERMDISP2 analysis (point 5).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Import the mia and vegan packages, load peerj13075 with \texttt{data} and store it
  into a variable named \texttt{tse}.
\item
  Transform the \texttt{counts} assay into relative abundances with \texttt{transformAssay}.
\item
  Extract the relative abundance assay, transpose it and save it into
  a variable named \texttt{relabund\_assay}.
\item
  Perform PERMANOVA with \texttt{adonis2} to see how much Diet can explain the relative
  abundance assay (\texttt{formula\ =\ relabund\_assay\ \textasciitilde{}\ Diet}) in terms of Bray-Curtis
  dissimilarity (\texttt{method\ =\ "bray"}). Also set \texttt{data\ =\ colData(tse)}
  \texttt{by\ =\ "margin"} and \texttt{permutations\ =\ 99}. What do the results tell you about
  Diet with respect to beta diversity?
\item
  \textbf{Extra}: Test homogeneity of distribution across Diet groups with
  \texttt{anova(betadisper(my\_mat),\ my\_groups}, where \texttt{my\_mat} is the Bray-Curtis
  dissimilarity matrix of \texttt{relabund\_assay} calculated with
  \texttt{vegdist(relabund\_assay,\ "bray")} and \texttt{my\_groups} is the vector of Diet values
  obtained from the colData of the TreeSE.
\end{enumerate}

Well done! You went through testing the effect and significance of Diet on beta
diversity. Keep in mind that the formula fed to \texttt{adonis2} can take more than one
independent variable, so that you can also (and very often should) include
covariates of your studies.

\hypertarget{redundance-analysis-rda}{%
\subsection{Redundance analysis (RDA)}\label{redundance-analysis-rda}}

Here we apply RDA, an ordination method that provides dimensions with
the largest variation between the data based in the light of the specified
variables (point 3). The results of RDA are usually assessed with PERMANOVA
(point 5) and the homogeneity assumption should be checked as in the previous
exercise. This is a relatively complex procedure, but the way this is broken
down into steps below will hopefully make more sense.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Import the mia and vegan packages, load peerj13075 with \texttt{data} and store it
  into a variable named \texttt{tse}.
\item
  Transform the \texttt{counts} assay into relative abundances with \texttt{transformAssay}.
\item
  Perform RDA with \texttt{calculateRDA} to see how much Diet can explain the relative
  abundance assay (\texttt{formula\ =\ assay\ \textasciitilde{}\ Diet} and \texttt{assay.type\ =\ relabundance}) in
  terms of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (\texttt{method\ =\ "bray"}).
\item
  Extract the RDA dimensions from the appropriate reducedDim slot with
  \texttt{attr(reducedDim(tse,\ "RDA"),\ "rda)} and store it into \texttt{rda}.
\item
  Test the effect and significance of Diet on beta diversity by PERMANOVA with
  \texttt{anova.cca}. Feed this function with \texttt{rda} and set \texttt{by\ =\ "margin"} and
  \texttt{permutations\ =\ 99}, respectively. What do the results tell you about Diet?
\item
  \textbf{Extra}: Check what other parameters are stored in the colData of peerj13075,
  add them to the formula (\texttt{formula\ =\ assay\ \textasciitilde{}\ Diet\ +\ ...}) of \texttt{calculateRDA}
  and proceed to see how that changes the results of PERMANOVA.
\end{enumerate}

Well done! You went through an RDA analysis followed by significance testing
with PERMANOVA and BETADISPER2. In the next exercise we'll go deeper quantify
the contributions to beta diversity.

\hypertarget{beta-diversity-analysis}{%
\subsection{Beta diversity analysis}\label{beta-diversity-analysis}}

\item
  Interpret your results. Is there association between community composition and location? What are those taxa that differ the most; find information from literature.

  and check for each individual experiment with \texttt{dim}, \texttt{nrow} and \texttt{ncol}.
\item
  What are the names of the features and samples of the different experiments?
  You can see that with \texttt{rownames} and \texttt{colnames}, respectively.
\item
  What information is known about the samples? Remember that information about
  samples is stored in the \texttt{colData} of the MAE.
\item
  \textbf{Extra}: How do the samples of the individual experiments map to the
  columns of the MAE? You can find the sample mapping in the \texttt{sampleMap}
  of the MAE.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{experiment-agglomeration}{%
\subsection{Experiment agglomeration}\label{experiment-agglomeration}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Import the mia package, load HintikkaXOData with \texttt{data} and store it into a

  desired assay.
\item
  \textbf{Extra}: Repeat step 1 thorugh 4 also for the microbiota and biomarkers
  experiments, so that a completely disassembled version of the MAE is available.
\item
  \textbf{Extra}: Besides experiments, MAEs also include a sampleData and a sampleMap,
  which are accessible with \texttt{colData(mae)} and \texttt{sampleMap(mae)}, respectively.
  Save also each of these two elements into a csv file.
\end{enumerate}

Well done! You just splitted a MAE into its components and stored them as csv files.

Next, we will try to reconstruct the same MAE from the files you created.
Make sure you know their names and location! Alternatively, you can download
\href{https://github.com/microbiome/course_2023_oulu/tree/main/data}{this directory}
with the readily disassembled components of HintikkaXOData.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Read in the csv files containing assays with \texttt{read.csv} and save each
  of them into a variable named \texttt{\textless{}assay\ name\textgreater{}\_assays}.
\item
  Create one TreeSE from each assays object with the \texttt{TreeSummarizedExperiment}
  function, as explained in \protect\hyperlink{construct-TreeSE}{this exercise}.
\item
  Read in the sampleData and the sampleMap and store them into the
  variables \texttt{sample\_data} and \texttt{sample\_map}, respectively.
\item
  Combine the components with \texttt{MultiAssayExperiment}, where the first argument
  is an \texttt{ExperimentList} (for now include only the microbiota and metabolites
  TreeSEs), the second is colData and the third is sampleMap.
\item
  Make sure that the MAE experiments are identical to the original TreeSEs. You
  can do that qualitatively by checking their \texttt{head} and quantitatively by
  looking at their \texttt{dim}.
\item
  \textbf{Extra}: Add the biomarkers TreeSE as a new experiment to the MAE.
  Note that new experiments can be added to a MAE through simple concatenation
  with \texttt{c(mae,\ experiment)}.

\tightlist
\item
  Import the mia package, load HintikkaXOData with \texttt{data} and store it into a

\item
  Analyze correlations between the microbiota and the biomarkers experiments
  with \texttt{getExperimentCrossAssociation}. Don't forget to specify the experiments
  you want to compare with the arguments \texttt{experiment1} and \texttt{experiment2}, and
  which of their assays with \texttt{assay.type1} and \texttt{assay.type2}.
\item
  What does the output look like? By default, correlation is measured in terms
  of Kendall tau coefficients. Repeat point 2, but this time change \texttt{method}
  to Spearman coefficients.
\item
  Are you able to infer significance from the output? In order to also obtain
  p-values from the cross-correlation analysis, repeat point 2 with the
  additional argument \texttt{test\_significance\ =\ TRUE}.
\item
  Visualize results with a heatmap similarly to the example in section
  \ref{cross-correlation}. Do you see any significant correlations?
  Interpret your results.
\item
  \textbf{Extra}: Perform cross-correlation analysis between the remaining
  experiments (microbiota vs metabolites and metabolites vs biomarkers) and
  visualize results with heatmaps.
\end{enumerate}

Great job! You performed a cross-correlation analysis between two experiments of
a MAE and visualized the results with a heatmap. You are also able to customise

\hypertarget{compare-permanova}{%
\section{PERMANOVA comparison}\label{compare-permanova}}

Here we present two possible uses of the \texttt{adonis2} function which performs PERMANOVA. The

This work would not have been possible without the countless
contributions and interactions with other researchers, developers, and
users. We express our gratitude to the entire Bioconductor community
for developing this high-quality open research software repository for
life science analytics, continuously pushing the limits in emerging
fields \citep{Gentleman2004}, \citep{Huber2015}.

The presented framework for microbiome data science is based on the
\emph{TreeSummarizedExperiment} data container created by Ruizhu Huang and
others \citep{R_TreeSummarizedExperiment}, \citep{Ernst2020}, and on the
\emph{MultiAssayExperiment} by Marcel Ramos et al. \citep{Ramos2017}. The idea
of using these containers as a basis for microbiome data science was
initially advanced by the groundwork of Domenick Braccia, Héctor
Corrada Bravo and others and brought together with other microbiome
data science developers \citep{Shetty2019}. Setting up the base ecosystem
of packages and tutorials was then subsequently led by Tuomas Borman,
Felix Ernst, and \href{http://www.iki.fi/Leo.Lahti}{Leo Lahti}. We would
specifically like to thank everyone who contributed to the work
supporting the \emph{TreeSummarizedExperiment} ecosystem for microbiome
research, including but not limited to the R packages mia, miaViz,
miaTime, miaSim, philr, ANCOMBC, curatedMetagenomicData, scater,
scuttle, and other packages, some of which are listed in Section
\ref{ecosystem}. A number of other contributors have advanced the
ecosystem further, and will be acknowledged in the individual
packages, \href{https://github.com/microbiome/OMA/graphs/contributors}{pull
requests},
\href{https://github.com/microbiome/OMA/issues}{issues}, and other work.

Ample demonstration data resources supporting this framework have been
made available through the
\href{https://waldronlab.io/curatedMetagenomicData/}{curatedMetagenomicData}
project by Edoardo Pasolli, Lucas Schiffer, Levi Waldron and others
\citep{Pasolli2017}.

The work has drawn initial inspiration from many sources, most notably
from the work on \emph{phyloseq} by Paul McMurdie and Susan Holmes
\citep{McMurdie2013} who pioneered the work on rigorous and reproducible
microbiome data science ecosystems in R/Bioconductor. The phyloseq
framework continues to provide a vast array of complementary packages
and methods for microbiome studies. The Orchestrating Single-Cell
Analysis with Bioconductor, or
\href{https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/}{\emph{OSCA}} book by Robert
Amezquita, Aaron Lun, Stephanie Hicks, and Raphael Gottardo
\citep{Amezquita2020natmeth} has implemented closely related work on the
\emph{SummarizedExperiment} data container and its derivatives in the field
of single cell sequencing studies that have inspired this work.

In the background, the open source books by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang
Huber, Modern Statistics for Modern Biology \citep{Holmes2019} and by
Garret Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, the R for Data Science
\citep{Grolemund2017}, and Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking and
the associated online resources by Solomon Kurz \citep{McElreath2020} are
key references that have advanced reproducible data science training
and dissemination.
