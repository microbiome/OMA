Multi-omics approaches integrate data from multiple sources. For
example, we can integrate taxonomic abundance profiles with
metabolomic or other biomolecular profiling data to observe
associations, make predictions, or aim at causal
inferences. Integrating evidence across multiple sources can lead to
enhanced predictions, more holistic understanding, or facilitate the
discovery of novel biomarkers. In this section we demonstrate common
multi-assay data integration tasks.

Cross-correlation analysis is a straightforward approach that can
reveal strength and type of assocations between data sets. For instance,
we can analyze if higher presence of a specific taxon relates to higher
levels of a biomolecule.

The analyses can be facilitated by the multi-assay data containers,
_TreeSummarizedExperiment_ and _MultiAssayExperiment_. These are
scalable and contain different types of data in a single container,
making this framework particularly suited for multi-assay microbiome
data incorporating different types of complementary data sources in a
single reproducible workflow. Solutions to a number of data
integration problems are discussed in more detail in Section
\@ref(containers). Another experiment can be stored in _altExp_ slot
of SE data container. Alternatively, both experiments can be stored
side-by-side in a MAE data container (see sections \@ref(alt-exp) and \@ref(mae)
to learn more about altExp and MAE objects, respectively). Different
experiments are first imported as single-assay data containers similarly to
the case when only one experiment is present. After that, the
different experiments can be combined into one multi-assay data
container. The result is a MAE object with multiple experiments in its
experiment slot, or a TreeSE object with alternative experiments in
the altExp slot.

As an example, we use a dataset from the following publication:
[-@Hintikka2021] Xylo-oligosaccharides in prevention of hepatic
steatosis and adipose tissue inflammation: associating taxonomic and
metabolomic patterns in fecal microbiota with biclustering.
In this study, mice were fed either with a high-fat or a low-fat diet,
and with or without prebiotics, for the purpose studying whether prebiotics
attenuate the negative impact of a high-fat diet on health.

This example data can be loaded from microbiomeDataSets. The data is
already in MAE format. It includes three different experiments:
microbial abundance data, metabolite concentrations, and data about
different biomarkers. If you like to construct the same data object from the
original files instead, [here](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/containers.html#loading-experimental-microbiome-data) 
you can find help for importing data into an SE object.

```{r cross-correlation1}
# Load the data
data(HintikkaXOData, package = "mia")
mae <- HintikkaXOData
mae
```

```{r cross-correlation2}
if(!require(stringr)){
    install.packages("stringr")
    library(stringr)
}
# Drop off those bacteria that do not include information in Phylum or lower levels
mae[[1]] <- mae[[1]][!is.na(rowData(mae[[1]])$Phylum), ]
# Clean taxonomy data, so that names do not include additional characters
rowData(mae[[1]]) <- DataFrame(apply(rowData(mae[[1]]), 2, 
                                     str_remove, pattern = "._[0-9]__"))
# Microbiome data
mae[[1]]
```

```{r cross-correlation3}
# Metabolite data
mae[[2]]
```

```{r cross-correlation4}
# Biomarker data
mae[[3]]
```

## Cross-correlation Analysis


Next we can do the cross-correlation analysis. Let us analyse if
individual bacteria genera correlates with concentrations of
individual metabolites. This helps to answer the question: "If this
bacteria is present, is this metabolite's concentration then low or
high"?

```{r cross-correlation5}
# Agglomerate microbiome data at family level
mae[[1]] <- agglomerateByPrevalence(mae[[1]], rank = "Family")
# Does log10 transform for microbiome data
mae[[1]] <- transformCounts(mae[[1]], method = "log10", pseudocount = 1)

# Give unique names so that we do not have problems when we are creating a plot
rownames(mae[[1]]) <- getTaxonomyLabels(mae[[1]])

# Cross correlates data sets
correlations <- testExperimentCrossCorrelation(mae, 
                                               experiment1 = 1,
                                               experiment2 = 2,
                                               assay.type1 = "log10", 
                                               assay.type2 = "nmr",
                                               method = "spearman", 
                                               p_adj_threshold = NULL,
                                               cor_threshold = NULL,
                                               # Remove when mia is fixed
                                               mode = "matrix",
                                               sort = TRUE,
                                               show_warnings = FALSE)
```

Creates the heatmap

```{r cross-correlation6, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
if( !require("ComplexHeatmap") ){
    BiocManager::install("ComplexHeatmap")
    library("ComplexHeatmap")
}

# Create a heatmap and store it
plot <- Heatmap(correlations$cor,
                # Print values to cells
                cell_fun = function(j, i, x, y, width, height, fill) {
                    # If the p-value is under threshold
                    if( !is.na(correlations$p_adj[i, j]) & correlations$p_adj[i, j] < 0.05 ){
                        # Print "X"
                        grid.text(sprintf("%s", "X"), x, y, gp = gpar(fontsize = 8, col = "black"))
                        }
                    },
                heatmap_legend_param = list(title = "", legend_height = unit(5, "cm"))
                )
plot
```

## Multi-Omics Factor Analysis

Multi-Omics Factor Analysis [@Argelaguet2018] (MOFA) is an
unsupervised method for integrating multi-omic data sets in a
downstream analysis.  It could be seen as a generalization of
principal component analysis. Yet, with the ability to infer a latent
(low-dimensional) representation, shared among the multiple (-omics)
data sets in hand.

We use the R [MOFA2](https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/index.html)
package for the analysis, and
[install](https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/installation.html) the
corresponding dependencies.

```{r MOFA2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(!require(MOFA2)){
    BiocManager::install("MOFA2")
}

# For inter-operability between Python and R, and setting Python dependencies,
# reticulate package is needed
if(!require(reticulate)){
    install.packages("reticulate")
}

# Let us assume that these have been installed already.
#reticulate::install_miniconda(force = TRUE)
#reticulate::use_miniconda(condaenv = "env1", required = FALSE)
#reticulate::py_install(packages = c("mofapy2"), pip = TRUE, python_version=3.6)
```

The `mae` object could be used straight to create the MOFA model. Yet,
we transform our assays since the model assumes normality per
default. We can also use Poisson or Bernoulli distributions among others.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(MOFA2)
# For simplicity, classify all high-fat diets as high-fat, and all the low-fat 
# diets as low-fat diets
colData(mae)$Diet <- ifelse(colData(mae)$Diet == "High-fat" | 
                              colData(mae)$Diet == "High-fat + XOS", 
                            "High-fat", "Low-fat")

# Removing duplicates at the microbiome data
# which are also in form e.g. "Ambiguous" and "uncultured" taxa
mae[[1]] <- mae[[1]][!duplicated(rownames(assay(mae[[1]]))), ]

# Transforming microbiome data with rclr
mae[[1]] <- transformCounts(mae[[1]], method = "relabundance")
mae[[1]] <- transformCounts(mae[[1]], assay.type = "relabundance", method = "rclr")

# Transforming metabolomic data with log10
mae[[2]] <- transformCounts(mae[[2]], assay.type = "nmr",
                            MARGIN = "samples",
                            method = "log10")

# Transforming biomarker data with z-transform
mae[[3]] <- transformCounts(mae[[3]], assay.type = "signals",
                            MARGIN = "features",
                            method = "z", pseudocount = 1)

# Removing assays no longer needed
assay(mae[[1]], "counts") <- NULL
assay(mae[[1]], "log10") <- NULL
assay(mae[[2]], "nmr") <- NULL
assay(mae[[3]], "signals") <- NULL

# Building our mofa model
model <- create_mofa_from_MultiAssayExperiment(mae,
                                               groups = "Diet", 
                                               extract_metadata = TRUE)
model
```

Model options could be defined as follows:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model_opts <- get_default_model_options(model)
model_opts$num_factors <- 5
head(model_opts)
```

Model's training options are defined with the following:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
train_opts <- get_default_training_options(model)
head(train_opts)
```

Preparing and training the model:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model.prepared <- prepare_mofa(
  object = model,
  model_options = model_opts
)

# Some systems may require the specification `use_basilisk = TRUE`
# so it has been added to the following code
model.trained <- run_mofa(model.prepared, use_basilisk = TRUE)
```

Visualizing the variance explained:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
library(patchwork)
library(ggplot2)
wrap_plots(
    plot_variance_explained(model.trained, x="view", y="factor", plot_total = T),
    nrow = 2
) + plot_annotation(title = "Variance Explained per factor and assay",
                    theme = theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)))
```

The top weights for each assay using all five factors:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
plots <- lapply(c("microbiota", "metabolites","biomarkers"), function(name) {
    plot_top_weights(model.trained,
                     view = name,
                     factors = "all",
                     nfeatures = 10) +
        labs(title = paste0("Top weights of the ", name," assay"))
})
wrap_plots(plots, nrow = 3) & theme(text = element_text(size = 8))
```
