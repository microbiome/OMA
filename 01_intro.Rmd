This work - [**Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis with R and
Bioconductor**](microbiome.github.io/OMA) [@OMA] - contributes novel
methods and educational resources for microbiome data science.  It
aims to teach the grammar of Bioconductor workflows in the context of
microbiome data science. We show through concrete examples how to use
the latest developments and data analytical strategies in
R/Bioconductor for the manipulation, analysis, and reproducible
reporting of hierarchical, heterogeneous, and multi-modal microbiome
profiling data.

The data science methodology is tightly integrated with the broader
R/Bioconductor ecosystem that focuses on the development of of
high-quality open research software for life sciences (@Gentleman2004,
@Huber2015). The support for modularity and interoperability is a key
to efficient resource sharing and collaborative development both
within and across research fields. The central data infrastructure,
the `SummarizedExperiment` data container and its derivatives, have
already been widely adopted in microbiome research, single cell
sequencing, and in other fields, allowing a rapid adoption and
extensions of emerging data science techniques across application
domains.

The book is organized into three parts. We start by introducing the
material and link to further resources for learning R and
Bioconductor. We describe the key data infrastructure, the
`TreeSummarizedExperiment` class that provides a container for
microbiome data, and how to get started by loading microbiome data set
in the context of this new framework. The second section, *Focus
Topics*, covers the common steps in microbiome data analysis,
beginning with the most common steps and progressing to more
specialized methods in subsequent sections. Third, *Workflows*,
provides case studies for the various datasets used throughout the
book. Finally, *Appendix*, links to further resources and
acknowledgments.



## Getting started

The reader is already expected to be familiar with R
programming. However, if you are new to R, you could try
[swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) for a kickstart to R
programming. Further support resources are available through the
[Bioconductor project](http://bioconductor.org/).



## Community support

This online resource and its associated ecosystem of microbiome data
science tools are a result of a community-driven development process,
and welcoming new users and contributors. You can find more
information on how to find us online and join the developer community
through the project homepage at
